      "rioxx2_description": "Background\r\nPollen calendars are a clear and concise way of presenting pollen season information to the public and health care professionals as well as other researchers in the field of aerobiology. In the UK, approximately 20% of the population is currently affected by seasonal respiratory symptoms from various pollen types including Corylus spp, Alnus spp, Betula spp, Quercus spp, Poaceae & Urticaceae, amongst others. The pollen data from the UK network of pollen monitoring stations demonstrates spatial and temporal variations across the country but there is no scientifically rigorous data to show this regional pattern for all these taxa in a format suitable for the public arena, i.e. regional pollen calendars. The aim of this study was to therefore produce a set of regional pollen calendars for the UK.\r\nMethods\r\nPollen data, for 2004-2013, collected at UK pollen monitoring stations using Burkard 7-day volumetric spore traps, was used to compile regional pollen calendars for ten years.

      "abstract": "Background\r\nPollen calendars are a clear and concise way of presenting pollen season information to the public and health care professionals as well as other researchers in the field of aerobiology. In the UK, approximately 20% of the population is currently affected by seasonal respiratory symptoms from various pollen types including Corylus spp, Alnus spp, Betula spp, Quercus spp, Poaceae & Urticaceae, amongst others. The pollen data from the UK network of pollen monitoring stations demonstrates spatial and temporal variations across the country but there is no scientifically rigorous data to show this regional pattern for all these taxa in a format suitable for the public arena, i.e. regional pollen calendars. The aim of this study was to therefore produce a set of regional pollen calendars for the UK.\r\nMethods\r\nPollen data, for 2004-2013, collected at UK pollen monitoring stations using Burkard 7-day volumetric spore traps, was used to compile regional pollen calendars for ten years. A simplified version for GPs and general public containing the six most important allergens in the UK was presented. The simplified calendars were presented in tabular form showing coloured duration bars with peak period, mean onset and end dates (2.5\/97.5% method), first high day, mean number of high days and seasonal catch, per taxon.  A complete data set with additional taxa will also be produced for specialist use by researchers and healthcare professionals. \r\nResults \r\nThe calendars highlight the spatial and temporal variations across the UK, indicating that the southern and central sites generally have the longest and most severe seasons, which start and finish the earliest and have the greatest number of high count days. The sites furthest west and north have later, shorter and milder seasons by comparison.\r\nConclusions\r\nThe pollen calendars have highlighted the spatial and temporal differences in the UK’s pollen seasons and provided accessible data for the public and health care professionals.",

      "rioxx2_description": "Bacterial resistance to antibiotics is considered as natural phenomenon that occurs over the time due to genetic changes. Bacterial resistance to antibiotics is significantly increasing in the UAE. Self-medication with antibiotics has been identified as a major factor for the development of antibiotic resistance, which is significantly increasing in the UAE.The purpose of this study was to explore the factors that contribute to the use of antibiotics without prescriptions among first year healthcare university students in UAE.Based on the findings of an earlier survey study, a qualitative interview study was designed to explore common themes related to student's knowledge, awareness, attitude, views, and perceptions. Data were analyzed thematically for the identification of themes and subthemes within the data through the use of coding.The interview study identified four main themes with multiple subthemes related to the use of antibiotics without a physician's prescription by first-year healthcare students. The thematic analysis of the interviews revealed four main themes; medication habits and practices; reasons for self-medication; access to antibiotics without a prescription and gaps in students' knowledge regarding antibiotic resistance.Healthcare students in UAE are influenced by several factors including parents and friends influence, successful previous experience and investment of time and money to visit a physician. Our sample of healthcare students has a misconception about the use of antibiotics. The current interview study identified six new reasons for using antibiotics without prescriptions as compared to our earlier survey study. There is a need of multifaceted strategies to decrease unnecessary antibiotic use in our population sample.",

      "abstract": "Bacterial resistance to antibiotics is considered as natural phenomenon that occurs over the time due to genetic changes. Bacterial resistance to antibiotics is significantly increasing in the UAE. Self-medication with antibiotics has been identified as a major factor for the development of antibiotic resistance, which is significantly increasing in the UAE.The purpose of this study was to explore the factors that contribute to the use of antibiotics without prescriptions among first year healthcare university students in UAE.Based on the findings of an earlier survey study, a qualitative interview study was designed to explore common themes related to student's knowledge, awareness, attitude, views, and perceptions. Data were analyzed thematically for the identification of themes and subthemes within the data through the use of coding.The interview study identified four main themes with multiple subthemes related to the use of antibiotics without a physician's prescription by first-year healthcare students. The thematic analysis of the interviews revealed four main themes; medication habits and practices; reasons for self-medication; access to antibiotics without a prescription and gaps in students' knowledge regarding antibiotic resistance.Healthcare students in UAE are influenced by several factors including parents and friends influence, successful previous experience and investment of time and money to visit a physician. Our sample of healthcare students has a misconception about the use of antibiotics. The current interview study identified six new reasons for using antibiotics without prescriptions as compared to our earlier survey study. There is a need of multifaceted strategies to decrease unnecessary antibiotic use in our population sample.",

One way to achieve this objective is to employ distributed antenna systems (DASs) in which remote antenna units (RAUs) are deployed on each floor of a building and connected to a central unit (CU) where received signals are constructively processed. However, co-channel interference caused by frequency reuse is a restraining factor as the frequency reuse distances are generally smaller in indoor radio systems. In order to design efficient and reliable indoor communication systems, a thorough understanding of the reuse distance is required. This paper investigates a number of important issues associated with indoor radio propagation and frequency reuse planning in multi-storey buildings employing DAS and presents numerical results showing the impact of reuse distance, penetration loss, pathloss exponent, and co-channel interference on spectral efficiency. System performance is evaluated in terms of average spectral efficiency over a wide range of potential mobile terminal (MT) locations for various and in-building propagation characteristics.",

      "rioxx2_description": "Fresh-cut cantaloupe melon is valued for its aroma but is highly perishable. Temperature of storage (typically 0-5°C) is critical for maintaining fresh-cut melon quality, but often reaches 10 Â°C during transportation and in retail outlets. A comparison amongst 0, 5 and 10 Â°C storage temperatures for fresh-cut melon over 14 days reveals that storage at 0 Â°C is optimal for avoiding increases in microbial load and loss of vitamin C especially at later time points. However, higher temperatures maintain better the balance of esters (acetate versus non-acetate) and phenolic content. The whole volatile organic compound (VOC) profile can be used to discriminate both time and temperature effects especially at earlier time points. Potential VOC markers for changes in vitamin C from day 0 to day 6 of storage (3-methyl butane nitrile) and temperature (limonene) are identified through a multi-trait analysis.",

      "abstract": "Fresh-cut cantaloupe melon is valued for its aroma but is highly perishable. Temperature of storage (typically 0-5°C) is critical for maintaining fresh-cut melon quality, but often reaches 10 Â°C during transportation and in retail outlets. A comparison amongst 0, 5 and 10 Â°C storage temperatures for fresh-cut melon over 14 days reveals that storage at 0 Â°C is optimal for avoiding increases in microbial load and loss of vitamin C especially at later time points. However, higher temperatures maintain better the balance of esters (acetate versus non-acetate) and phenolic content. The whole volatile organic compound (VOC) profile can be used to discriminate both time and temperature effects especially at earlier time points. Potential VOC markers for changes in vitamin C from day 0 to day 6 of storage (3-methyl butane nitrile) and temperature (limonene) are identified through a multi-trait analysis.",

The newspapers reported Grace’s death four days later and referred to her contribution to the Women’s Industrial Council and her role in setting up the first Trade School for Girls in London for waistcoat making. At the age of 35, Grace, a respectable middle-class married woman from Coulsdon in Surrey, also a career woman who had studied at Newman College Cambridge, faked her own death. She did so in order to start a new life with her lover, Walter Reeve, on the other side of the world, far away from family and friends. After travelling for many months, first to Australia and then onwards to New Zealand, the couple arrived in Wellington where Walter developed a career as a doctor and Grace gave birth to, and raised, three children. Thanks to subterfuge and changing their names, the pair was able to disguise their unmarried status and hide their past lives, thus enabling Grace to become a pillar of the different communities in which they lived. Grace played an active role in voluntary work to support the Allies in the First World War, became a stalwart of the Women’s Institute movement and was active in the Girl Guides.",

      "rioxx2_title": "Participant Centred Learning in Management Education: The Case for Learning in Turkey",
      "rioxx2_description": "Current research into participant centred learning (PCL) has identified that management education is often criticized for being \"repositories of multiple frameworks that are not tightly integrated and are aging rapidly\" (Mahoney & McGahan, 2007, p. 86). Others have voiced concerns with regard to the lack of effectiveness of strategic management education (Jarzabkowski & Kaplan, 2015; Porter & McKibbin, 1988; Mintzberg & Gosling, 2002). This has led to increasingly frequent calls for more relevant and practically applicable management education (e.g., Bower, 2008; Mintzberg, 2004; Greiner, Bhambri & Cummings, 2003; Rynes, Bartunek & Daft, 2001; Starkey & Madan, 2001).  Furthermore, teaching and learning approaches that might work in one educational context may be far more problematic in other contexts (Catalo, Antheaume & Howayda, 2015) and so knowledge transfer has to take the local context into account.  \r\nWhilst there is a growing bank of knowledge in the field of the use of case methodologies in management education in Turkey, the aim of this research have been to identify opportunities and barriers to learning in this particular geographical and cultural context.  According to the Turkish Ministry of Development 10th Development Plan (2014-2018), one of the main goals of the education system must be to raise individuals with a sense of entrepreneurship and innovation.  The plan further suggests that the harmony between the education system and the labour market will be enhanced by equipping people with skills and competences with a lifelong learning perspective by internalizing the entrepreneurship culture.  This culture is to be developed by programmes at all levels of the education system to enhance the quality of existing entrepreneurship programs.  Many support programmes for business managers and entrepreneurs exist in Turkey, including various modes of managerial training.  However, these programmes primarily focus on teaching actual or potential entrepreneurs the functional areas of business, be it marketing, finance, or strategy, without exactly customizing the topics to the entrepreneur’s own situation.  PCL methods allow the entrepreneur and\/or future business managers to learn and investigate within their own context, making the learning more relevant and directly applicable than general theoretical principles.  Hence the students’ capability of “learning to learn” is enhanced, promoting chances of future organisational survival.  This aspect of PCL makes it a valuable addition to curriculum development, tools of delivery, and adult learning research and applications developed within Faculties of Education in Turkey.\r\nThis study presents the results of a study of a convenience sample of over 200 Turkish academics and graduate students who have participated in one or more workshops on teaching with case studies or writing case studies, conducted across Turkey over the time period of February 2016 to November 2017.  These higher education scholars represent business schools, university-based technoparks, and other related institutions having a desire to develop their PCL methodologies, totalling about 80 organizations located across all regions of Turkey.  The data were collected through an online survey that was announced after each workshop, so the data collection was fully voluntary.  The survey included both open and closed questions to provide data to determine potential trends in the adoption and adaptation of the case method in management education, and the barriers and resistors to change, in contrast to more traditional methods of classroom delivery.  \r\nAccording to the preliminary results, some of the key positive attributes of the case method in the Turkish classroom as depicted by the qualitative answers to the survey include:\r\n•\tThe dynamism that cases bring to courses, both for students and instructors\r\n•\tMaking clear links between theory and practice\r\n•\tThe opportunities to ‘jump into the shoes’ of the entrepreneur or the professional\r\n•\tIts capacity for practice based learning\r\n•\tThe opportunities provided to solve real life problems \r\n•\tContribution to analytical thinking\r\n•\tEnhancing decision making skills\r\n•\tPromoting and fostering interest and participation in the class\r\nHowever, some of the most frequently noted barriers to case development in Turkey include:\r\n•\tThey push students to adopt in-depth analytically approaches which are often unfamiliar to the learner\r\n•\tDifficulties in establishing the collaborative links with firms from which to extract case data\r\n•\tLack of experience – on the part of both students and teachers\r\n•\tThere are very limited good cases which focus on Turkey \r\n•\tLack of willingness of students to prepare for a case discussion prior to the class\r\n•\tStudents tend to prefer a more directed approach.\r\nThe findings demonstrate that there are significant pockets of research in Turkey that are already exploring some of these concepts and methodologies.  However, this research also notes a reticence for change in management education, and an unwillingness on the part of the student and the tutor, to embrace the principles of PCL in the classroom, citing longstanding cultural traditions of directive learning that continue to provide barriers to the adoption of more PCL-type approaches.\r\nFuture work will entail building on the exploratory phase of the study to generate theoretical foundations of effective classroom usage of the case study method in management and entrepreneurship education for the Turkish context.  The cultural factor in the Turkish education system that encourages a controlled ‘spoonfeeding’ approach to teaching may be in part due to the power distance in the Turkish society (students versus instructors), and also the cultural tendency towards uncertainty avoidance.  In order to tackle such deep set issues, one can conduct a series of experiments in classroom settings in order to identify whether teaching style, salience of the case topic to the audience, group versus individual work, prior preparation, length and type of case study, etc. would aid in overcoming the inertia and resistance towards the case study approach that may be faced in a typical Turkish classroom setting.  The next steps of the study aim to lead to testable hypotheses regarding various dimensions of effective teaching and learning with the case study approach toward PCL for future and present managers and entrepreneurs in Turkey.",

      "abstract": "Current research into participant centred learning (PCL) has identified that management education is often criticized for being \"repositories of multiple frameworks that are not tightly integrated and are aging rapidly\" (Mahoney & McGahan, 2007, p. 86). Others have voiced concerns with regard to the lack of effectiveness of strategic management education (Jarzabkowski & Kaplan, 2015; Porter & McKibbin, 1988; Mintzberg & Gosling, 2002). This has led to increasingly frequent calls for more relevant and practically applicable management education (e.g., Bower, 2008; Mintzberg, 2004; Greiner, Bhambri & Cummings, 2003; Rynes, Bartunek & Daft, 2001; Starkey & Madan, 2001).  Furthermore, teaching and learning approaches that might work in one educational context may be far more problematic in other contexts (Catalo, Antheaume & Howayda, 2015) and so knowledge transfer has to take the local context into account.  \r\nWhilst there is a growing bank of knowledge in the field of the use of case methodologies in management education in Turkey, the aim of this research have been to identify opportunities and barriers to learning in this particular geographical and cultural context.  According to the Turkish Ministry of Development 10th Development Plan (2014-2018), one of the main goals of the education system must be to raise individuals with a sense of entrepreneurship and innovation.  The plan further suggests that the harmony between the education system and the labour market will be enhanced by equipping people with skills and competences with a lifelong learning perspective by internalizing the entrepreneurship culture.  This culture is to be developed by programmes at all levels of the education system to enhance the quality of existing entrepreneurship programs.  Many support programmes for business managers and entrepreneurs exist in Turkey, including various modes of managerial training.  However, these programmes primarily focus on teaching actual or potential entrepreneurs the functional areas of business, be it marketing, finance, or strategy, without exactly customizing the topics to the entrepreneur’s own situation.

      "rioxx2_description": "Alternaria species are ubiquitous fungi affecting food security and human health. They are pathogenic on many economically important crops and allergenic to many sensitive people worldwide. Studies from Worcester, UK have shown high a concentration of Alternaria spores, most likely caused by agricultural activities. However, it is unknown whether Alternaria spore concentrations vary geographically throughout Worcestershire. An investigation on the spatial variation in bi-hourly concentration of Alternaria spores in Worcestershire during 2016 and 2017 was conducted. Spores were sampled using two Hirst-type Burkard spore traps at the University of Worcester. One on the rooftop of a building at St John’s Campus and another at Lakeside Campus approximately 7 km away. St John’s Campus is located in the centre of Worcester (52.1970, -2.2421), while Lakeside Campus is located in an agricultural environment (52.2537, -2.2535) with regularly cut grass in the near surroundings. Slides were counted using bi-hourly traverse at x 400 magnification. The total number of spores per slide were converted to the daily mean of spores m¯³ of air. There was a highly positive correlation in the concentration of Alternaria spores between the two sites in both 2016 and 2017. St John’s had the highest peak of spore concentration (213 m¯³) in 2016 and Lakeside had the peak concentration in 2017 (184 m¯³). Concentrations above 100 m¯³ of air were observed more frequently at Lakeside. The study revealed that Alternaria spore concentrations were higher at Lakeside than at St John’s. This could be attributed to spores released from either crops or agricultural activities (e.g. haying or harvesting) or from decomposed grass since the surrounding area is routinely managed. Further work in 2018 will include spore correlations with weather variables from a pair of weather stations located at each site, enabling studies caused by variations in weather and climate. Spatial variation in bi-hourly spore concentrations is useful information to atopic subjects, health experts and crop pathologists. \r\n\r\nKeywords: Harvesting. Allergy. Fungal Spores.",

By turns anorexic, angelic, vampiric, disabled, disfigured, medicalised, migrainous, and monstrous, the bodies we find in these stories are unpredictable, and secretive, broken or uncomfortable, prone to becoming transparent, losing their boundaries or disappearing entirely. Through close readings of two stories from the collection, ‘Comma’and ‘The Heart Fails Without Warning’, I will demonstrate how Mantel depicts her characters’ bodies as spaces where metaphor and materiality interact, as essentially biocultural. This biocultural quality, I will argue, is ultimately the source of their profound precarity, making these bodies available for degredation and negation by a wealth of social and cultural forces.The various modes of embodiment available to Mantel’s characters foreground a series of interacting class-based and gendered understandings of certain bodies which act to nullify, over-simplify or oppress those who live in them by rendering them non-human.",

      "rioxx2_description": "Summary Objectives Futsal game requires players to perform frequent bouts of high-intensity activity with limited rest periods that are not sufficient for full recovery. Therefore, creatine supplementation may enhance performance by improving recovery rate. Along with this, the number of studies conducted to determine the effects of creatine on performance in the females is scarce. Thus, the main aim of this study is to identify the effects of short-term (7\/day) creatine supplementation on leg strength, velocity and agility in young female futsal players. Equipment and methods A total of thirty of young female futsal players (aged: 19.83±1.13 years) participated in the study which was designed as randomized and double-blind, on a voluntary basis. Participants were randomly assigned either to creatine (n=15) or placebo (n=15) group. Over 7 days, creatine group received 0.25g\/kg\/day micronized pure creatine monohydrate (Creapure, Hardline Nutrition, Kavi Gıda Istanbul, Turkey) and placebo group did not take any supplements, apart from maltodextrin (Fantomalt, Nutricia, United Kingdom). Before and after 7 days of loading creatine supplementation, body weight, leg strength, velocity and agility performance of the participants were determined. The data obtained were analysed with ANCOVA statistical model. Results Creatine supplementation significantly improved 10m, 20m and 30m speed performances (P<0.05), leg strength (P<0.05) and agility (P<0.05) in female futsal players. Depending on the creatine loading, however, no significant change in body weight was observed (P>0.05). The data obtained provide that 7 days low dose creatine supplementation may be an effective approach for improving exercise capacity in female futsal players without an associated increase in body weight. Résumé Objectifs Le jeu de futsal exige que les joueurs effectuent de fréquentes périodes d’activité de haute intensité avec des périodes de repos limitées qui ne sont pas suffisantes pour une récupération complète. Par conséquent, la supplémentation en créatine peut améliorer les performances en améliorant le taux de récupération. Parallèlement à cela, le nombre d’études menées pour déterminer les effets de la créatine sur la performance chez les femmes est rare. Ainsi, le but principal de cette étude est d’identifier les effets de la supplémentation en créatine à court terme (7\/jour) sur puissance des jambes, la vélocité et l’agilité chez les jeunes joueuses de futsal féminines. Équipement et méthodes Au total, une trentaine de jeunes joueuses de futsal (âgées de 19,83±1,13 ans) ont participé à l’étude, conçue comme une étude randomisée et en double insu, sur base volontaire. Les participants ont été assignés au hasard soit au groupe créatine (n=15) ou au groupe Placebo (n=15). Sur 7jours, le groupe créatine a reçu 0,25g\/kg\/jour de monohydrate de créatine pure micronisée (Creapure, Hardline Nutrition, Kavi Gida Istanbul, Turquie) et le groupe placebo n’a pas pris de suppléments hormis la maltodextrine (Fantomalt, Nutricia, Royaume-Uni). Avant et après 7jours de chargement de supplémentation en créatine, le poids corporel, la force des jambes, la vélocité et l’agilité des participants ont été déterminés. Les données obtenues ont été analysées avec le modèle statistique ANCOVA. Résultats La supplémentation en créatine a significativement amélioré les performances en vitesse de 10m, 20m et 30m (p<0,05), la force des jambes (p<0,05) et l’agilité (p<0,05) chez les joueuses de futsal. Cependant, en fonction de la charge en créatine, aucun changement significatif du poids corporel n’a été observé (p<0,05). Les données obtenues indiquent qu’une supplémentation en créatine à faible dose de 7jours peut être une approche efficace pour améliorer la capacité d’exercice chez les joueuses féminines de futsal sans augmentation associée du poids corporel.",

Worcester’s ‘Sing4Breath’ COPD choir was formed\r\nin 2014, initially consisting of people with COPD who had attended the local\r\npulmonary rehabilitation programme.

Much of the literature focuses on financial altruism using economic games, however altruism can also comprise of non-financial acts, which this experiment examined in an attempt to replicate and refine previous findings. A study was conducted with 199 participants, who viewed both high attractive and low attractive opposite-sex images and were asked how likely they would be to altruistically share their research credits with the person in the image, whilst controlling for self-rated attractiveness. The findings suggest that both men and women were more altruistic towards pictures of high attractive than low attractive potential mating partners (Cohen’s d = 0.37). This study therefore partially replicates previous research examining the role of mate choice effects when exploring non-financial altruism.",

The final inventory is gridded to a 5 x 5 km resolution using a stereographic projection.\r\nResults: The sites with the highest European Infection levels were recorded in the north of Italy at Busto Arsizio (VA3) (European Infection level 2003-2014 = 52.1) and Magenta (MI7) (European Infection level 2003-2014 = 51.3), whereas the sites with the lowest (i.e. around 0.0) were generally located to the south of the country. Analysis\r\nshowed that the European Infection level in all of Italy was significantly lower in 2013-14 compared to 2003-12, and this decrease was even more pronounced at the sites in\r\nthe area where Ophraella communa was distributed. Cross-validations show that the sensitivity to the inclusion of stations is typically below 1% (for two thirds of the stations) and that the station Magenta (MI7) had the largest impact compared to all other stations.\r\nDiscussion: This is the first time that pollen source inventories from different temporal periods have been compared in this way, and has implications for simulating\r\ninterannual variations in pollen emission as well as evaluating the management of anemophilous plants like Ambrosia artemisiifolia.",

      "rioxx2_description": "Childhood obesity is one of the most serious global public health challenges. However, obesity and its consequences are largely preventable. As parents play an important role in their children's weight-related behaviours, good communication between parents and health care professionals (HCPs) is essential. This systematic review provides a meta-synthesis of qualitative studies exploring the barriers and facilitators experienced by HCPs when discussing child weight with parents. Searches were conducted using the following databases: MEDLINE (OVID), Psych INFO (OVID), EMBASE (OVID), Web of Knowledge and CINAHL. Thirteen full-text qualitative studies published in English language journals since 1985 were included. Included studies collected data from HCPs (e.g., nurses, doctors, dieticians, psychologists, and clinical managers) concerning their experiences of discussing child weight-related issues with parents. An inductive thematic analysis was employed to synthesize findings. Emerging subthemes were categorized using a socio-ecological framework into intra\/interpersonal factors, organizational factors, and societal factors. Perceived barriers and facilitators most commonly related to intra\/interpersonal level factors, that is, relating to staff factors, parental factors, or professional-parent interactions. HCPs also attributed a number of barriers, but not facilitators, at the organizational and societal levels. The findings of this review may help to inform the development of future weight-related communication interventions. Whilst intra\/interpersonal interventions may go some way to improving health care practice, it is crucial that all stakeholders consider the wider organizational and societal context in which these interactions take place. Statement of contribution What is already known on the subject? Childhood obesity is one of the United Kingdom's most serious current public health challenges. Health care professionals are in a prime position to identify child weight issues during routine consultations. However, they often feel unable or unequipped to raise the topic and provide information on child weight management. What does this study add? To our knowledge, this is the first review to synthesize barriers and facilitators to discussing child weight. This review interprets key barriers and facilitators in the context of the socio-ecological model. Supports the development of interventions matched to the appropriate level of the socio-economic model. [Abstract copyright: © 2018 The Authors.

The essay includes a wide range of evidence, including original analysis of texts by Beddoes, Keats, Shelley, Smith, Wordsworth, et al. I hope the essay will be an influential intervention into literary history and ‘periodisation’.",

      "abstract": "This essay re-interprets the distinctive ‘generations’ of Romantic writing as self-aware expressions of cultural and political affiliation, proposing a third generation which extends the British Romantic period into the commodity culture of the mid-nineteenth century. The essay includes a wide range of evidence, including original analysis of texts by Beddoes, Keats, Shelley, Smith, Wordsworth, et al. I hope the essay will be an influential intervention into literary history and ‘periodisation’.",

There has been a paucity of research in the area, furthermore the field has become strongly associated with postgraduate courses (e.g. Rowe and Braud, 2013), opposed to investigating how transpersonal education may be applied to the early years and compulsory schooling sector. Recently, there have been attempts to redefine transpersonal education to provide a balanced focus within compulsory schooling (Buckler, 2011; Buckler, 2013), with initial research suggesting that the field has cross-cultural interest. This paper extends research into the concept through analysing current publications in the field, while also deriving international perspectives from participants. To conclude, a discussion of the UK context is provided where an opportunity is highlighted for transpersonal psychologists to lead future development.",

The two athletes are a similar age and have a similar experience in terms of the media, political and cultural time periods and the comparison builds upon other trans-Atlantic comparative media studies.  \r\n The presentation will acknowledge the historical context, academic literature and contemporary empirical illustrations will provide an opportunity to support and challenge the burgeoning debate around lesbian athletes in the media, in particular, around the themes of: ambivalence, scrutiny and invisibility of the athletes or their sexuality. Additionally, it will analyse the assumptions that the media portrays lesbian athletes and their sexual identity through: contradictory ideas, critical observations and ignorance will be substantively explored. This presentation will examine the current debates around women in the sporting media before linking it with sexuality. The discussion on women sport and media will predominately be based on print media (which can consumed online) rather than social media. The use of case studies will acknowledge the changing nature of the print media in relation to two openly lesbian athletes.",

      "rioxx2_description": "Gluten elimination may represent an effective treatment strategy for mood disorders in individuals with gluten-related disorders. However, the directionality of the relationship remains unclear. We performed a systematic review of prospective studies for effects of gluten on mood symptoms in patients with or without gluten-related disorders. Six electronic databases (CINAHL, PsycINFO, Medline, Web of Science, Scopus and Cochrane Library) were searched, from inception to 8 August 2018, for prospective studies published in English. Meta-analyses with random-effects were performed. Three randomised-controlled trials and 10 longitudinal studies comprising 1139 participants fit the inclusion criteria. A gluten-free diet (GFD) significantly improved pooled depressive symptom scores in GFD-treated patients (Standardised Mean Difference (SMD) −0.37, 95% confidence interval (CI) −0.55 to −0.20; p < 0.0001), with no difference in mean scores between patients and healthy controls after one year (SMD 0.01, 95% CI −0.18 to 0.20, p = 0.94). There was a tendency towards worsening symptoms for non-coeliac gluten sensitive patients during a blinded gluten challenge vs. placebo (SMD 0.21, 95% CI −0.58 to 0.15; p = 0.25). Our review supports the association between mood disorders and gluten intake in susceptible individuals. The effects of a GFD on mood in subjects without gluten-related disorders should be considered in future research.",

      "abstract": "Gluten elimination may represent an effective treatment strategy for mood disorders in individuals with gluten-related disorders. However, the directionality of the relationship remains unclear. We performed a systematic review of prospective studies for effects of gluten on mood symptoms in patients with or without gluten-related disorders. Six electronic databases (CINAHL, PsycINFO, Medline, Web of Science, Scopus and Cochrane Library) were searched, from inception to 8 August 2018, for prospective studies published in English. Meta-analyses with random-effects were performed. Three randomised-controlled trials and 10 longitudinal studies comprising 1139 participants fit the inclusion criteria. A gluten-free diet (GFD) significantly improved pooled depressive symptom scores in GFD-treated patients (Standardised Mean Difference (SMD) −0.37, 95% confidence interval (CI) −0.55 to −0.20; p < 0.0001), with no difference in mean scores between patients and healthy controls after one year (SMD 0.01, 95% CI −0.18 to 0.20, p = 0.94). There was a tendency towards worsening symptoms for non-coeliac gluten sensitive patients during a blinded gluten challenge vs. placebo (SMD 0.21, 95% CI −0.58 to 0.15; p = 0.25). Our review supports the association between mood disorders and gluten intake in susceptible individuals. The effects of a GFD on mood in subjects without gluten-related disorders should be considered in future research.",

A focus group of people living with dementia and family carers, and a reference group of practitioners helped to develop a competency framework which was refined through focus groups with Admiral Nurses working in different areas.\r\nFindings: The literature review, survey and interviews provided a framework grounded in up-to-date evidence and contemporary practice. There was broad agreement in the literature and the practitioners’ priorities regarding the core competencies of advanced practice, with constructive suggestions for making the framework useable in practice.

Shared variance between intermediate positions and rank order lap times (ROSPT) with finishing positions were calculated, along with probability of automatic qualification, for athletes in each available race position at the end of every 400 m lap. Differences in race positions and lap times relative to season´s best (SB) performances were assessed between automatic qualifiers (AQ), fastest losers (FL), and non-qualifiers (NQ).\r\nResults: Race positions at the end of each 400 m lap remained more stable through 800 m races than 1500 m races. Probability of automatic qualification decreased with both race position and ROSPT on each lap, although ROSPT accounted for a higher degree of shared variance than did intermediate position. In the 1500 m event FL ran at a higher percentage of SB speed, and adopted positions closer to the race lead in the early stages. This was not the case in the 800 m.\r\nConclusions: Intermediate positioning and the ability to produce a fast final race segment are strongly related to advancement from qualification rounds in middle distance running events. The adoption of a more ‘risky’ strategy characterized by higher speeds relative to SB may be associated with increased likelihood of qualification as FL in the 1500 m event.",

The aim of this review is to summarize recent advances in research and provide a brief overview of the history of the condition for the benefit of professionals working in gastroenterology. Academic databases such as PubMed and Google Scholar were searched using key words such as ”non-celiac gluten sensitivity”, “gluten related disorders”, and the studies outlined in reference page were selected and analysed.\r\n\r\n Most of the analysed studiers agree that NCGS would need to be diagnosed only after exclusion of celiac disease and wheat allergy, and that a reliable serological marker is not available presently. The mechanisms causing symptoms in NCGS after gluten ingestion are largely unknown, but recent advances have begun to offer novel insights. The estimated prevalence of NCGS, at present, varies between 0.6 and 6%. There is an overlap between irritable bowel syndrome and NCGS with regard to the similarity of gastrointestinal symptoms. The histologic characteristics of NCGS are still under investigation, ranging from normal histology to slight increase in the number of T lymphocytes in the superficial epithelium of villi. Positive response to gluten free diet for a limited period (e.g., 6 weeks), followed by the reappearance of symptoms after gluten challenge appears, at this moment, to be the best approach for confirming diagnosis. The Salerno expert criteria may help to diagnose NCGS accurately in particular for research purposes but it has limited applicability in clinical practice.",

      "rioxx2_description": "Depression is the most commonly experienced mental health condition in adults with Autism Spectrum Conditions (ASC). However, it is unclear what tools are currently being used to assess depression in ASC, or whether tools need to be adapted for this group. This systematic review therefore aimed to identify tools used to assess depression in adults with and without ASC, and then evaluate these tools for their appropriateness and measurement properties. Medline, PsychINFO and Web of Knowledge were searched for studies of depression in: a) adults with ASC, without co-morbid intellectual disability; and b) adults from the general population without co-morbid conditions. Articles examining the measurement properties of these tools were then searched for using a methodological filter in PubMed, and the quality of the evidence was evaluated using the COSMIN checklist. Twelve articles were identified which utilised three tools to assess depression in adults with ASC, but only one article which assessed the measurement properties of one of these tools was identified and thus evaluated. Sixty-five articles were identified which utilised five tools to assess depression in general population adults, and 14 articles had assessed the measurement properties of these tools. Overall, two tools were found to be robust in their measurement properties in the general population – the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II), and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Crucially only one study was identified from the COSMIN search, which showed weak evidence in support of the measurement properties of the BDI-II in an ASC sample. Implications for effective measurement of depression in ASC are discussed.",

      "rioxx2_description": "Adults diagnosed with autism are at significantly increased risk of suicidal thoughts, suicidal behaviours and dying by suicide. However, it is unclear whether any validated tools are currently available to effectively assess suicidality in autistic adults in research and clinical practice. This is crucial for understanding and preventing premature death by suicide in this vulnerable group. This two stage systematic review therefore aimed to identify tools used to assess suicidality in autistic and general population adults, evaluate these tools for their appropriateness and measurement properties, and make recommendations for appropriate selection of suicidality assessment tools in research and clinical practice. Three databases were searched (PsycInfo, Medline and Web of Knowledge). Four frequently used suicidality assessment tools were identified, and subsequently rated for quality of the evidence in support of their measurement properties using the COSMIN checklist. Despite studies having explored suicidality in autistic adults, none had utilised a validated tool. Overall, there was lack of evidence in support of suicidality risk assessments successfully predicting future suicide attempts. We recommend adaptations to current suicidality assessment tools and priorities for future research, in order to better conceptualise suicidality and its measurement in autism.",

However, it is young people for whom austerity has had the most deleterious effects, with the poli-cy changes in higher education funding in 2011 being emblematic.

The government rationalised these changes as a way to pay for the increasing student population.

      "rioxx2_description": "Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) allows single-base resolution and genome-wide profiling of DNA methylation in plants and animals. This technology provides a powerful tool to identify genes that are potentially controlled by dynamic changes of DNA methylation and demethylation. However, naturally occurring epimutants are rare and genes under epigenetic regulation as well as their biological relevances are often difficult to define. In tomato, fruit development and ripening are a complex process that involves epigenetic control. We have taken the advantage of the tomato epimutant Colourless non-ripening (Cnr) and performed comparative mining of the WGBS datasets for the Cnr and SlCMT3-silenced Cnr fruits. We compared DNA methylation profiles for the promoter sequences of approximately 5,000 bp immediately upstream of the coding region of a list of 20 genes. Differentially methylated regions were found for some of these genes. Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) of differentially methylated gene SlDET1 or SlPDS resulted in unusual brown pigmentation in Cnr fruits. These results suggest that comparative WGBS coupled with VIGS can be used to identify genes that may contribute to the colourless unripe phenotype of fruit in the Cnr epimutant.

      "rioxx2_description": "Non-cell autonomous RNA silencing can spread from cell to cell and over long-distance in animals and plants. However, the genetic requirements and signals involved in plant mobile silencing remain poorly understood. Here, we identified a DICER-LIKE2 (DCL2)-dependent mechanism for systemic spread of post-transcriptional RNA silencing (also known as post-transcriptional gene silencing, PTGS) in Nicotiana benthamiana. Using a suite of transgenic DCL RNAi lines coupled with a GFP reporter, we demonstrated that N. benthamiana DCL1, DCL2, DCL3 or DCL4 is required to produce microRNAs, 22, 24 or 21nt small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), respectively. All sized siRNAs produced in local incipient cells were present at low levels in distal tissues. Inhibition of DCL2 expression reduced the long-distance spread of silencing, as opposed to suppression of DCL3 or DCL4 which enhanced systemic PTGS. DCL2-DCL4 double-RNAi developed systemic PTGS like DCL2 RNAi lines, but in contrast to DCL4 RNAi lines. We further show that 21 or 24nt local siRNAs processed by DCL4 or DCL3 were not correlated with long-distance spread of systemic silencing. Grafting experiments demonstrated that DCL2 was required in the scion to respond to the signal, but not in the rootstock to produce\/send the signal. These results suggest a coordinated DCL genetic pathway in which DCL2 plays an essential role in systemic PTGS, whilst both DCL4 and DCL3 may act as attenuators of systemic PTGS in N. benthamiana. The potential role of 21, 22 and 24nt siRNAs in long-distance spread of PTGS is discussed.",

      "rioxx2_description": "Globally, the potentially harmful effects of using cell phone technology for 'sexting' among young people, is a public health concern. The background literature indicates that sexting might have adverse psychosocial consequences for some young people who share partially nude images ('selfies'). Public health nurses (PHNs) could offer guidance to children and young people on digital safety, yet little is known about their role in this regard. This study explored PHNs' knowledge and confidence in addressing the issue among young people. A qualitative study was undertaken using the Critical Incident Technique. The study took place in 2016. Eighteen semi-structured interviews were conducted with PHNs in a region of England. Data were analysed through thematic analysis, and managed through the use of NViVo 11 software. From the entire data set, thirteen critical incidents were identified of which nine were deemed relevant for reporting in this paper. PHNs regarded sexting as a contemporary 'normalised' practice that takes place in what young people consider to be trusting relationships. PHNs' knowledge was informed by media reports that supported their beliefs about young peoples' vulnerability to risk-taking sexual behaviour. They were not confident about discussing sexting with young people, even though some PHNs had done so in light of concerns about potential child sexual exploitation. PHNs have a role to play in advising young people on digital safety, but findings of the study show that their role is not fully realised. They have some knowledge of sexting as a possible signifier of abusive behaviour. However, they are not always confident in dealing with the issue. Improving PHNs ability to promote digital safety through better understanding of technology use among young people is good safeguarding practice. This may, in turn, better define this important nursing contribution to public health.",

      "rioxx2_description": "The immune suppressive mechanisms displayed by malignant cells are considered a central process in the pathogenesis of cancer. Research in this area has gained significant momentum over the past 20 years, with several immune checkpoints identified, including; CTLA-4, CD200\/CD200R, Tim-3\/Galectin-9 and PD-L1\/PD-1 (Figure 1). Whilst characterising the molecular basis of leukaemia for risk stratification remains at the forefront of AML research; this must now extend to understating how these immune checkpoint pathways fit into the equation. A good example of why this is important is to consider CD200 expression\r\nlevel in AML, which is a negative prognostic indicator [1]. CD200 is an immunosuppressive ligand, that when engaged with its receptor CD200R, has the capacity to attenuate T-cell and NK-cell anti-tumour activity. Interestingly, most cases of CBF AML express high levels of CD200, yet CBF AML performs relatively well clinically. This paradox suggests there is a complex interplay between AML molecular heterogeneity and immune surveillance. Given the recent development and FDA approval of several immune checkpoint therapies, a full understanding of these processes and integration with standard molecular risk stratification is warranted.",

Anthocyanins are pigments within berries and other colourful fruits and vegetables. They have anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory actions that improve recovery from exercise. Furthermore, anthocyanins can also affect vasoactive properties, including decreasing mean arterial blood pressure and increasing vasodilation during exercise. In vitro observations have shown anthocyanin- and metabolite-induced activation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase and human vascular cell migration. However, effects of anthocyanins on exercise performance without a prior muscle-damaging or metabolically demanding bout of exercise is less clear. For example, exercise performance effects have been observed for blackcurrant, but are less apparent for cherry, therefore indicating that the benefits could be due to the specific source-dependent anthocyanins. The mechanisms by which anthocyanin intake can enhance exercise performance may include effects on blood flow, metabolic pathways, and peripheral muscle fatigue, or a combination of all.

      "rioxx2_description": "Intake of the catechin epigallocatechin gallate and caffeine has been shown to enhance exercise-induced fat oxidation. Matcha green tea powder contains catechins and caffeine and is consumed as a drink. We examined the effect of Matcha green tea drinks on metabolic, physiological and perceived intensity responses during brisk walking. Thirteen females (age: 27±8 yr, body mass: 65±7 kg, height: 166±6 cm) volunteered. Resting metabolic equivalent (1-MET) was measured using Douglas bags (1-MET: 3.4±0.3 ml·kg-1·min-1). Participants completed an incremental walking protocol to establish the relationship between walking speed and oxygen uptake and individualize the walking speed at 5- or 6-MET. A randomized cross-over design was used with participants tested between day 9 and 11 of the menstrual cycle (follicular phase). Participants consumed 3 drinks (each drink made with 1 gram of Matcha premium grade, OMGTea Ltd UK) the day before, and 1 drink 2 hours before the 30-min walk at 5- (n=10) or 6-METs (walking speed: 5.8±0.4 km·h-1) with responses measured at 8-10, 18-20 and 28-30 min. Matcha had no effect on physiological and perceived intensity responses. Matcha resulted in lower respiratory exchange ratio (control: 0.84±0.04; Matcha: 0.82±0.04) (P < 0.01) and enhanced fat oxidation during a 30-min brisk walk  (control: 0.31±0.10; Matcha: 0.35±0.11 g·min-1) (P < 0.01). Matcha green tea drinking can enhance exercise-induced fat oxidation in females. However, when regular brisk walking with 30-min bouts is being undertaken as part of a weight loss program, the metabolic effects of Matcha should not be overstated.",

The modification used a widely available low-cost peripheral gaming device and required only basic construction and computer skills. The instrumented treatment plinth was validated against a laboratory grade force platform across a range of applied masses from 0.5–15 kg, mock Gr I-IV vertebral mobilisations and a dynamic response test. Intraclass correlation coefficients demonstrated poor reliability (0.46) for low masses of 0.5 kg improving to excellent for larger masses up to15 kg respectively; excellent to good reliability (0.97-0.86) for the mock mobilisations and moderate reliability (0.51) for the dynamic response test. The study demonstrates how a cheap peripheral gaming device can be repurposed so that forces applied to a hydraulic treatment plinth can be collected reliably when applied in a clinically reasoned manner.",

Although the British American Tobacco Company (BAT) experienced severe upheavals as a result of each of the two global military conflagrations of the twentieth century, this paper argues that in terms of its organizational memory there exist clear distinctions between the two. During the course of World War I, BAT was able for the first time to generate a degree of common identity which served it well in the course of its post war expansion during the 1920s. This emergence of a more unified culture, underpinned by a range of common reference points for its staff based on texts, buildings and monuments, facilitated a company-wide collective memory of the war which was subsequently used to promote an esprit de corps across the organization. During World War II, these common cultural reference points were not developed. Thus an organizational memory of World War II only emerged many decades after the event and took the form of a collected memory based on individual recollections.",

The aim of the study was to examine coaches’ beliefs surrounding game-based approaches, to explore the mechanisms coaches used to facilitate enhanced athlete decision making and to investigate the nature of athletes’ contribution to these mechanisms. Three multi-method case studies were employed comprising semi-structured interviews with the coaches, focus groups with the players and both structured and unstructured observations of multiple sessions. Through the data analysis process two major themes emerged that identified the specific approaches elite coaches were using to develop decision making within their performers i) questioning and group discussions; ii) game play and scenarios.  The findings identified that elite coaches who are committed to games-based approaches use similar strategies to develop decision making but often in different ways with varying impact. All coaches attempted to encourage discussions from the performers through questions and developing group debate but there is a balance to establish between coach and performer input to ensure everyone is involved and the players feel the benefit, and value this approach. There was evidence of a lack of understanding from some performers of this approach so coaches must educate the players on their chosen approach to ensure success. Scenarios and small-sided game play were also utilised and used as vehicles for reflective group discussion; however, mediating factors such as time pressure may hinder the deployment of such techniques. Future research should explore more elite contexts to better understand support that both the players and coaches may need to develop this approach successfully and consistently.",

All coaches attempted to encourage discussions from the performers through questions and developing group debate but there is a balance to establish between coach and performer input to ensure everyone is involved and the players feel the benefit, and value this approach. There was evidence of a lack of understanding from some performers of this approach so coaches must educate the players on their chosen approach to ensure success. Scenarios and small-sided game play were also utilised and used as vehicles for reflective group discussion; however, mediating factors such as time pressure may hinder the deployment of such techniques. Future research should explore more elite contexts to better understand support that both the players and coaches may need to develop this approach successfully and consistently.",

There is a need for reliable and valid measurement of EI in young people, with brief yet sensitive measures of the construct preferable for use in time-limited settings.  However, the proliferation of EI measures has often outpaced rigorous psychometric evaluation (Gignac, 2009). Using data from 849 adolescents (407 females; 422 males) aged 11 to 16 years (mean age 13.4; SD = 1.2 years), the current paper systematically examined the structural and predictive properties of a frequently employed measure of adolescent trait EI – the Emotional Quotient Inventory Youth Version Short Form - EQ-i:YV(S) (Bar-On & Parker, 2000). Whilst the intended multidimensional factor structure was recovered through confirmatory factor analysis, the statistical and conceptual coherency of the underlying model was inadequate.  Using a multi-trait multi-method approach, the EQ-i:YV(S) was found to converge with other measures of EI, however, evidence for divergent validity (Big Five personality dimensions) was less robust.  Predictive utility for adolescent mental health outcomes (depression; disruptive behavior) was also limited. Findings suggest that use of the EQ-i:YV(S) for predictive or evaluative purposes should be avoided until refinements to the scale are made.",

The aim of this longitudinal study was to explore the learning experiences of deaf international futsal players when using an online platform to support face to face learning in preparation for a major competition.\r\n\r\nThis study adopted a longitudinal design (8 month duration). Data was collected from 10 players and 3 staff members who were part of an International Deaf Women’s Futsal team. As an attempt to provide players with ‘contemporary learning solutions’ to best cater for their needs, this project focused on using an online learning platform to complement face to face learning. In this sense, participants had access to an online learning system, ‘Hive Learning’ and were encouraged to contribute to discussions regarding specific topics. Content included videos, pictures, diagrams and text. Data was collected via contributions to ‘Hive Learning’ as well as six focus groups during the 8 month period. Participants were encouraged to actively contribute to the variety of learning activities during and following attendance to each one of the six training camps leading up to the 2018 European Deaf Futsal Championships.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this ‘discovery session’ is to share the research findings from both an academic and practitioner's perspectives. The study will be presented by one of the Joint Head Coaches and the Performance Analyst of the team (who are also the researchers who developed this study). The session will be delivered in a ‘research showcase’ seminar format to allow coaches to reflect upon the findings in light of their own coaching context. It is hoped that this study can shed light on how coaches can develop ‘contemporary learning solutions’ to best cater for their players.\r\n\r\nFindings showed some players’ initial resistance to playing an active role in ‘co-constructing’ knowledge (i.e., learning as’ participation’ and ‘transformation’). Here, they showed signs of lacking confidence to express their opinion and\/or perceived the value of the online platform only as a repository of information (i.e., learning as acquisition). As the study developed, more players started engaging in critical thinking when trying to support each other’s’ learning as a team.\r\n\r\nThe lessons learned which can be directly applied in coaching practice are:\r\n•\tThe use of online platforms can be beneficial to complement face to face learning as long as they offer flexibility and evolve according to participants' needs.\r\n•\tCoaches should interpret what players’ needs and wants are. At times, challenging a player’s view (in a supportive environment) is necessary;\r\n•\tPerformance analyst roles should include more emphasis on analysis ‘for’ learning (it often focuses on analysis ‘of’ learning).",

      "rioxx2_description": "Parenting coordination (PC) has been in use since the mid-1980s, but research on its effectiveness is sorely lacking. We review the extant research organized by three themes: (1) parenting coordinators’ perceptions of their role and function; (2) professionals’ and parents’ views and perceptions of PC; and (3) outcomes of PC, including some measures of effectiveness of the PC process. While these studies provide some insight into PC effectiveness, there is still a lack of research that uses objective out- come measures of efficacy and that considers characteristics of the co-parent dyad, personality difficulties, or the professional discipline of the parenting coordinator. Future research recommendations are discussed. \r\nKey Points for practitioners \r\n•\tWhile parenting coordination (PC) is perceived by professionals to be effective, the research on PC effectiveness is limited by a small number of studies of variable quality; therefore there is no robust evidence of its effectiveness in practice. \r\n•\tThere is a need for research on PC effectiveness that considers parent engagement, conflict level, and personality variables as well as professional discipline of the parenting coordinator.\r\n•\tWhile the Association for Family and Conciliation Courts and the American Psychological Association guidelines provide a model for PC practice, there is a distinct lack of theoretical underpinning of the PC practice. \r\n•\tIt is imperative for professionals and researchers to collaborate toward the development of a unified theoretical model to inform the PC role and practice, which in turn will allow objective assessment of its effectiveness.",

Future research recommendations are discussed. \r\nKey Points for practitioners \r\n•\tWhile parenting coordination (PC) is perceived by professionals to be effective, the research on PC effectiveness is limited by a small number of studies of variable quality; therefore there is no robust evidence of its effectiveness in practice. \r\n•\tThere is a need for research on PC effectiveness that considers parent engagement, conflict level, and personality variables as well as professional discipline of the parenting coordinator.\r\n•\tWhile the Association for Family and Conciliation Courts and the American Psychological Association guidelines provide a model for PC practice, there is a distinct lack of theoretical underpinning of the PC practice. \r\n•\tIt is imperative for professionals and researchers to collaborate toward the development of a unified theoretical model to inform the PC role and practice, which in turn will allow objective assessment of its effectiveness.",

      "rioxx2_description": "The research enquired into undergraduate students’ perception of their “learner journey” through the course of their degree, and considers the role they believe Library Services has, will, or should play in this. As librarians become increasingly teaching focused, and information literacy becomes more crucial to employability, it is important to understand how students perceive their learner journey to ensure information literacy instruction aligns with their need for library input both in terms of content and timing. \r\n\r\nThe research is a qualitative study employing focus groups and a one-to-one interview. Five undergraduate students took part in the research, representing levels four to six of study, and five of the University’s seven academic institutes. Drawing on the principles of grounded theory, the data was analysed thematically and by means of constant comparative analysis. Five principal themes were identified: transition to, and preparedness for, university, progression, personal responsibility and engagement, employability, and communication. A narrative interpretation of the research contextualises these responses with regards to the literature and the current higher education environment.  \r\n\r\nThe literature suggests that whilst there is a body of research around librarians’ support of students’ information literacy development, little prior work has been done specifically on the learner journey. Additionally, what is available either relates primarily to Further Education or approaches the journey in terms of the route taken into study rather than the skills attained once at university. This research addresses this gap in existing research, and concludes that whilst further work remains, it is clear that students do see a role for librarians in their conceptualisation of their learner journeys, and that in the realisation of these journeys Library Services has generally played a positive and supportive role. It is recommended that further cycles of research be carried out, and that Library Services continues its programme of engagement, outreach, and support.",

In England, this sector of education consists of a range of levels and types of provision in both public and private providers of further, adult and continuing vocational and skills based learning.  The analysis considers expectations, challenges and responses at the education system level, at institutional level and at practitioner level in the context of shifting government policies.  At the system level, the analysis considers societal perceptions of academic and vocational learning and the provision and quality of training and continuing professional learning for VET teachers.  At the institutional level, policies and support systems developed by VET providers to support students in colleges and workplaces in partnership with employers on different forms of college and work-based training, including apprenticeships, are considered.  At practitioner level, the chapter examines teaching, learning and assessment strategies used by VET teachers to enable vocational learning in different settings, from classrooms, workshops and laboratories in colleges and simulated learning environments to work placements in real working businesses. To support the highest standards of vocational and technical learning, colleges, VET teachers and employers have to work in sustained partnerships to provide inspirational teaching in innovative learning environments, both college based and in workplaces.",

      "rioxx2_description": "This article offers insights into the ethics of engagement and methodological issues and dilemmas in cross-cultural interpretation for researchers who are positioned at different points of the insider-outsider spectrum.  The discussion uses examples from qualitative research with Sikh families in Britain and focuses on the design of the methodology and co-interpretation of data from in-depth interviews, both during the interactive data gathering phase and the post-interview analysis and interpretation phase.  The researchers represent differing degrees of insider-outsiderness in relation to the British Sikh community; one is a cultural insider (a Sikh) whilst the other is an outsider (non-Sikh).  In other respects they share a number of characteristics, including gender, a history of migration, bilingualism and living and teaching in superdiverse communities which all impact on the nature of their engagement with the research participants and with each other as co-researchers.  Our reflexive analysis shows that established binary distinctions and polarities in research practice, such as insider\/outsider, are inadequate for conceptualising the fluidity and complexity of the ethics of engagement in co-researching. We argue that both theoretically and empirically a more nuanced conceptualisation reflects the realities of multiple researcher positionalities, interpretations and power relations.",

      "rioxx2_title": "Modelling Cultural Change by Implementing Technology for Multi-Agency Information Sharing",
      "rioxx2_description": "Background:\r\nInter-organisational information sharing systems are widely accepted as the norm in private sector \r\norganisations, from small scale  customer relationship  management systems  to  highly  complex, \r\nintelligent, information sharing systems. Local government trails behind in the adoption of such \r\nsystems, Desmond and Koteche (2017) confirming that “the state, unlike private enterprise, is \r\nstruggling to innovate”. Nevertheless, local government is increasingly required to deliver more \r\nwith tightening budgets, so a push to find technological solutions to deliver a leaner but optimal \r\nservice is vital. Sivarajah and Irani (2018) go so far as to suggest that councils could become \r\nleaders in how emerging technologies can be utilised for the benefit of the public, highlighting \r\nexamples including London Borough of Enfield Council’s chatbot, Amelia, dedicated to dealing with \r\nresident queries or authenticating licences and a drone supplied by Kent Fire and Rescue used to \r\nsurvey the ruins of Grenfell Tower.\r\nThe introduction of new technologies is a critical move in any organisation, regardless of its size \r\nand reach. New technologies enable an organisation to not only exploit its established capabilities \r\nbut also explore new businesses opportunities, both of which lead to innovation in its management \r\nprocesses, its products and services (Gibson and Birkinshaw, 2004; Guisado-González et al., 2017). \r\nSuch innovation often takes the form of new frameworks redefining the existing human relations at \r\nthe workplace.\r\nData is becoming more important in the way county councils deliver services to their residents. \r\nServices are provided by multiple agencies across the county council, however, to deliver an \r\noptimal, efficient and cost-effective service, it is required that the data is shared across \r\nagencies, but Cowell and Martin (2003) state that traditionally county council agencies operate as \r\nsilos. To utilise data effectively, county councils are looking to provide the foundation for more \r\nintegrated, user centric support across local providers by implementing a multi-agency information \r\nsharing technological solution (WODA, 2017). The county council understand the importance of a \r\nsuccessful project to empower workers with the knowledge and understanding to engage with emerging \r\ndata sharing opportunities with confidence. However, frontline workers have traditionally not been \r\nreceptive to technological change and information sharing. Without the engagement of the system \r\nusers, the frontline workers, the project to implement an information sharing technology solution \r\nwill fail. A need therefore arises to investigate the attitudes, and the impact on relationships \r\nand culture, across the multi-agency local government when implementing an information technology \r\nsolution.\r\nHence, the aim of this research is to develop a framework that models the cultural change within a \r\ncomplex organisation when implementing an information sharing technology solution.\r\nTo achieve its aim, the study proposes a longitudinal study that seeks to understand the cultural \r\nchange that takes place within the organisation as the technology intervention project is \r\nimplemented. The project will be well-measured to include different settings and possibilities for \r\nbetter observations. Qualitative and quantitative methods including observation, interviews and \r\nsurveys will allow for the study of those changes as part of an action-research methodological \r\napproach involving a sample of up to 3,000 individuals directly involved in the processes being \r\nstudied.\r\n\r\nThe motivation for completing this research comes firstly from Kate Dobson’s membership of the\r\nWorcester Office of Data Analytics (WODA) committee, the force behind the project to produce and \r\nimplement a single view information sharing system for Worcestershire County Council. The project \r\nand committee are still in their infancy, however, support and enthusiasm for the project is \r\ndemonstrated by leading agencies within the organisation, including the police, fire services, \r\nchildren’s services, acute hospital trusts and others. This research addresses an aspect of the \r\nproject not yet addressed by the committee, though highlighted as a requirement for the success of \r\nthe project and furthermore adds significant impact and value to the project.\r\nSecondly, the research and the success of the WODA project is driven by Kate Dobson’s first-hand \r\nexperience of the difficulties agencies have when multiple agencies have contact with a resident \r\nand they have no access to shared data.  The research seeks to suggest a lasting solution that can \r\nensure a better framework as far as the admission of new technologies in multi-agency working is \r\nconcerned.\r\nExpected Outcomes:\r\nThe anticipated result of the study will be to map the cultural change within the multi-agency \r\norganisation as the program of change progresses. The study will be expected to produce a framework \r\nfor modelling cultural change when implementing technology to create a single view information \r\nsharing system for a multi-agency organisation. The research will be expected to fill the gap that \r\nexists in the research around organisational change management occurring due to interventions with \r\ntechnology in multi-agency organisations. In Worcestershire County Council, agencies will use the \r\ndata system as a single view information sharing source of the residents of Worcestershire, \r\nensuring efficiencies, no data duplication and an aid to provide the residents of Worcestershire \r\nwith better local government services. This research will offer other Councils an insight of how \r\nthe application of the system can be used to provide efficient and cost saving services. This \r\nresearch will also provide a justification  that  a  framework  for  modelling  cultural  change  \r\nis  important  in  the  course  of\r\nimplementing new technology in a multi-agency organisation.",

      "abstract": "Background:\r\nInter-organisational information sharing systems are widely accepted as the norm in private sector \r\norganisations, from small scale  customer relationship  management systems  to  highly  complex, \r\nintelligent, information sharing systems. Local government trails behind in the adoption of such \r\nsystems, Desmond and Koteche (2017) confirming that “the state, unlike private enterprise, is \r\nstruggling to innovate”. Nevertheless, local government is increasingly required to deliver more \r\nwith tightening budgets, so a push to find technological solutions to deliver a leaner but optimal \r\nservice is vital. Sivarajah and Irani (2018) go so far as to suggest that councils could become \r\nleaders in how emerging technologies can be utilised for the benefit of the public, highlighting \r\nexamples including London Borough of Enfield Council’s chatbot, Amelia, dedicated to dealing with \r\nresident queries or authenticating licences and a drone supplied by Kent Fire and Rescue used to \r\nsurvey the ruins of Grenfell Tower.\r\nThe introduction of new technologies is a critical move in any organisation, regardless of its size \r\nand reach. New technologies enable an organisation to not only exploit its established capabilities \r\nbut also explore new businesses opportunities, both of which lead to innovation in its management \r\nprocesses, its products and services (Gibson and Birkinshaw, 2004; Guisado-González et al., 2017). \r\nSuch innovation often takes the form of new frameworks redefining the existing human relations at \r\nthe workplace.\r\nData is becoming more important in the way county councils deliver services to their residents. \r\nServices are provided by multiple agencies across the county council, however, to deliver an \r\noptimal, efficient and cost-effective service, it is required that the data is shared across \r\nagencies, but Cowell and Martin (2003) state that traditionally county council agencies operate as \r\nsilos. To utilise data effectively, county councils are looking to provide the foundation for more \r\nintegrated, user centric support across local providers by implementing a multi-agency information \r\nsharing technological solution (WODA, 2017). The county council understand the importance of a \r\nsuccessful project to empower workers with the knowledge and understanding to engage with emerging \r\ndata sharing opportunities with confidence. However, frontline workers have traditionally not been \r\nreceptive to technological change and information sharing. Without the engagement of the system \r\nusers, the frontline workers, the project to implement an information sharing technology solution \r\nwill fail. A need therefore arises to investigate the attitudes, and the impact on relationships \r\nand culture, across the multi-agency local government when implementing an information technology \r\nsolution.\r\nHence, the aim of this research is to develop a framework that models the cultural change within a \r\ncomplex organisation when implementing an information sharing technology solution.\r\nTo achieve its aim, the study proposes a longitudinal study that seeks to understand the cultural \r\nchange that takes place within the organisation as the technology intervention project is \r\nimplemented. The project will be well-measured to include different settings and possibilities for \r\nbetter observations. Qualitative and quantitative methods including observation, interviews and \r\nsurveys will allow for the study of those changes as part of an action-research methodological \r\napproach involving a sample of up to 3,000 individuals directly involved in the processes being \r\nstudied.\r\n\r\nThe motivation for completing this research comes firstly from Kate Dobson’s membership of the\r\nWorcester Office of Data Analytics (WODA) committee, the force behind the project to produce and \r\nimplement a single view information sharing system for Worcestershire County Council. The project \r\nand committee are still in their infancy, however, support and enthusiasm for the project is \r\ndemonstrated by leading agencies within the organisation, including the police, fire services, \r\nchildren’s services, acute hospital trusts and others. This research addresses an aspect of the \r\nproject not yet addressed by the committee, though highlighted as a requirement for the success of \r\nthe project and furthermore adds significant impact and value to the project.\r\nSecondly, the research and the success of the WODA project is driven by Kate Dobson’s first-hand \r\nexperience of the difficulties agencies have when multiple agencies have contact with a resident \r\nand they have no access to shared data.  The research seeks to suggest a lasting solution that can \r\nensure a better framework as far as the admission of new technologies in multi-agency working is \r\nconcerned.\r\nExpected Outcomes:\r\nThe anticipated result of the study will be to map the cultural change within the multi-agency \r\norganisation as the program of change progresses. The study will be expected to produce a framework \r\nfor modelling cultural change when implementing technology to create a single view information \r\nsharing system for a multi-agency organisation. The research will be expected to fill the gap that \r\nexists in the research around organisational change management occurring due to interventions with \r\ntechnology in multi-agency organisations. In Worcestershire County Council, agencies will use the \r\ndata system as a single view information sharing source of the residents of Worcestershire, \r\nensuring efficiencies, no data duplication and an aid to provide the residents of Worcestershire \r\nwith better local government services. This research will offer other Councils an insight of how \r\nthe application of the system can be used to provide efficient and cost saving services. This \r\nresearch will also provide a justification  that  a  framework  for  modelling  cultural  change  \r\nis  important  in  the  course  of\r\nimplementing new technology in a multi-agency organisation.",

      "rioxx2_description": "Studies on the drive for muscularity (DFM) have primarily been quantitative and focused on men. Little is known about women’s experiences leading to high levels of desire for muscle. Our aim was to explore the stories of women with high DFM and unpack the socio-cultural and personal factors leading to their DFM. In-depth life-history interviews and multiple in-the-field conversations were undertaken with 11 female bodybuilders and weight trainers (Mean age=31.67, SD=6.73, years) scoring ≥ 3 on the Drive for Muscularity Scale (Mean=4.17, SD=0.84). Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using a thematic narrative analysis. Women’s stories focused on a set of early social interactions with significant others. In these interactions women were exposed to dominant social narratives of femininity and male hegemony. Women felt obliged to comply with contemporary corporeal gender norms, which were often reinforced by situations that emphasized their lack of compliance. Women’s narratives revealed that they initially developed strong desires to gain control over their own bodies and engaged in behaviors to conform their corporeal selves to cultural feminine ideal expectations. However, a range of activating events shattered women’s gendered ontological security. Consequently, they realized that adopting traditional feminine ideals left them fragile, and socially and emotionally vulnerable. Their realization led to the manifestation of DFM. Drawing on Goffman’s work, we reveal how women built a muscular, ‘unbreakable’ frontstage to conceal their frail backstage. Findings disclose the value of considering the ‘presentation of the self’ concept when extending knowledge on the DFM in women.",

      "rioxx2_description": "Against a United Kingdom policy background of attempts to widen higher education participation in a socially inclusive direction, this article analyses theory, policy and practice to understand why past efforts have had limited success and to propose an alternative: an \"anchor institution\" model. A university and a private training provider were the principal partners in this venture, known as the South-West Partnership; the model was developed by them to meet the particular needs of mature female students who want and\/or need to study part-time in a rural, coastal and isolated area of south-west England. While the concept of \"anchor institutions\" has previously been used in government social policy, and in higher education to promote knowledge transfer, it has not yet been adopted as a method for widening participation. The research study presented in this article investigated the effectiveness of the model in widening higher education participation in the context of the South-West Partnership. The study was conducted within an interpretivist theoretical framework. It accessed student voice to illustrate the character of education required to widen participation in vocational higher education by mature female students in rural communities, through semi-structured qualitative interviews on a range of topics identified from relevant theoretical literature, and by drawing on the research team's professional knowledge and experience. These topics included student aspirations and career destinations, motivations, access, learning experiences, and peer and tutor support. It is hoped the findings will inform the future development of adult vocational higher education provision in rural areas, where opportunities have been limited, and encourage further application of the anchor institution model for widening participation elsewhere.",

A university and a private training provider were the principal partners in this venture, known as the South-West Partnership; the model was developed by them to meet the particular needs of mature female students who want and\/or need to study part-time in a rural, coastal and isolated area of south-west England.

      "rioxx2_description": "Against a UK policy background of attempts to widen participation in higher education in a socially inclusive direction, this article aims to bring together theory, policy and practice to understand why past attempts have had only limited success and to propose an alternative possibility: an anchor institution model. The model has been developed to meet the particular needs of mature women students who wish and need to study part-time in a rural, coastal and isolated area of south-west England.

The artist and writer John Byrne’s first television commission was an adaptation of his 1978 stage play The Slab Boys. Forming part of the Play for Today series it was broadcast on 6 December 1979. This instigated a career in TV writing that would see him produce a number of high profile and critically acclaimed dramas such as Tutti Frutti (1987), Your Cheatin’ Heart (1990) and a one off adaptation of Boswell and Johnson’s Tour of the Western Isles (1993). His TV work articulates a version of Scottishness that is forever filtered through memory and myth, however it is also far from sentimental. Rooted in his Paisley childhood, his screenplays are tapestries of working class culture, shot through with a celebration of near-contemporary postmodernity.\r\nThe article examines how Byrne depicts Scottish identity and how his particular vision uses music and pop culture as a way of discussing Scotland’s relationship to the rest of the world, most notably America. Looking at the broad sweep of Byrne’s TV work, it also considers how his background in painting and graphic design has underpinned characterization and narrative in his plays and series. Byrne’s paintings are full of self-portraits and portraits of friends and family, and this reliance on the autobiographical and the familiar can also be read in his television scripts. Byrne was writing mainly in the 1980s and ‘90s, a time of great change for British television as a whole, and so this chapter also offers a snapshot of an age of auteurist television that has perhaps past.",

      "rioxx2_description": "Split-incentives of non-domestic building tenure that divide the benefits of implementing energy efficient technologies and behaviours between property owners and users are generally recognised to act as a financial barrier to the adoption of energy efficient interventions in UK non-domestic properties. Despite the extensive availability of cost effective energy efficient interventions that could overcome financial spilt-incentives for UK non-domestic building owners and users, widespread energy inertia prevails. This suggests the barriers presented by split-incentives of ownership exert an influence beyond financial decision-making. Rethinking the impact of split-incentives may therefore assist in unlocking energy inertia and contribute to the mitigation of climate change. \r\nThis paper reports the findings of a qualitative survey undertaken to investigate the impacts of non-domestic building ownership on the owners’ and users’ ability and willingness to adopt energy efficient and conservation technologies and behaviours. It explores the impacts of ownership beyond the reach of financial disincentives to adopt energy efficiency improvement and identifies four types of constraint affecting non-domestic building owners’ and users’ energy behaviours; ownership constraints, financial constraints, knowledge constrains and regulatory constraints. \r\nThe paper extends the understanding of the scale and scope of split-incentives of non-domestic building ownership for energy performance improvement within non-domestic buildings and presents a wider scope of the split of incentives of ownership than previously established. It also explores the opportunity this new understanding offers for reforming UK energy policies. Findings suggest the impacts of tenure are influential beyond monetary considerations for non-domestic building owners and users and include practical and attitudinal barriers from relationships, contractual constraints and ownership concerns, which drive energy inertia through the Owner-User Stalemate",

In response, I have developed an innovative learning, teaching and assessment platform for Education for Sustainability within the business curriculum: audit-based learning.\r\nIn this conceptual paper I present audit-based learning as an experiential, active learning, teaching, and assessment platform that is designed to enhance case-based learning for Education for Sustainability within the business curriculum. I suggest audit-based learning, which offers direct personal encounters with complex (un)sustainable situations and a multi-dimensional format for data analysis, can advance case-based learning through the completion of a sustainability audit. Audit-based learning enlists students’ preferences for active learning to promote sustainability knowledge, skills and values and employment skills demanded by businesses. \r\nThis study will help educators build capacity of staff to engage students in generative sustainability through active learning for Education for Sustainability within the business curriculum. Its’ exploration of audit-based learning builds on existing pedagogic discourse of innovative learning, teaching and assessment methodologies and contributes to research into participatory approaches to Education for Sustainability.",

However, this recognition is at odds with the long standing non-domestic energy culture which views energy as a low cost resource and limitless availability as an entitlement. \r\nEnergy policies have generally relied on voluntary rational economic behavioural responses to financial initiatives established to support the UK’s 2050 Pathway and carbon emissions reductions targets. However, many non-domestic users have not adopted the financially beneficial energy efficient technologies and behaviours as expected and progress towards mitigating climate change is now stalling. Since 2012 carbon emissions reductions have been largely confined to the power sector, whilst emissions from the UK’s non-domestic building stock have been rising. Predictions now suggest that, without the introduction of more challenging measures to supplement existing progress, the energy transition pathways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 80% of 1990 levels will be missed. \r\nThis paper suggests that these challenging measures could include soft rationing of non-domestic energy supplies to transform the UK’s current non-domestic energy culture that provokes socio-economic energy inertia by decarbonising energy sources, to one which values energy as a finite resource and promotes reduction of energy use. Soft rationing, delivered through a scheme of energy allowances to cap non-domestic energy use, may reenergise the pathway to mitigating climate change by promoting sustainable energy choices which focus on how much energy is needed rather than how much is used.",

It evaluates the approaches’ ability to provide the hands-on learning that Business Management students prefer. \r\n\r\nStudy methodology\r\nThis study explores students’ qualitative and quantitative responses to pre- and post-module surveys and module evaluations to establish the effectiveness of focusing learning, teaching, research and assessment on a sustainability audit. The study, undertaken over a two-year period, adopts four measures of learning and teaching effectiveness to synthesise, evaluate and present the findings: development of sustainability knowledge and skill, employment skills, career and life skills and engagement. \r\n\r\nFindings\r\nThe study finds that a sustainability audit can develop students’ knowledge and skills in all four measures of learning and teaching effectiveness. In addition, the findings suggest it can raise students’ learning awareness and recognition of their role in the learning process. \r\n\r\nResearch limitations\/implications \r\nThis paper reports the findings of a small scale, two-year study. As such, it presents indicative findings rather than generalised conclusions. \r\n\r\nPractical implications \r\nDesigning a pedagogical approach to Education for Business Sustainability around the completion of a sustainability audit offers hands-on learning experiences that meet students’ preferences for interactive, experiential and collaborative learning within real world environments, employers’ demands for employment ready graduates and educators’ hopes for sustainability advocates. \r\n\r\nOriginality\/value \r\nThis study builds on existing pedagogic discourse of innovative learning and teaching means and methods. It provides insight into effective hands-on Education for Business Sustainability and offers experience based guidance to educators seeking to develop immersive, active and experiential, real world pedagogical approaches.",

This game provides an alternative collaborative learning environment to the traditional instructivist approach in order to enrich Education for Sustainability learning experiences and enhance student engagement.\r\nDesign\/Methodology\/Approach: Students’ reflections on their game-based learning experiences and suggestions for game development were collected through a short qualitative survey. Results are explored through three frameworks, the Multifaceted Student Value Model, the Dimensions of Engagement Framework and the UK Higher Education Authority Framework for Engagement Through Partnership.\r\nFindings: Research findings suggest the Sustainable Strategies Game provides game-based learning within Education for Sustainability that delivers ‘edutainment’ within an active, collaborative and experiential learning environment that the students value. It is also able to challenge thinking and emotionally engage students with the fundamentals of business sustainability. Reflection-on-action and the students’ role as co-researchers in game development allow students to become active participants in their learning as well as knowledge producers and evaluators. These outcomes deliver the UK Higher Education Authority’s core facets of student engagement through partnership.\r\nResearch limitations\/implications: This practice-focused study presents the self-reported results of a one-time, small study which does not offer generalised, independently validated responses. However, the findings may be of interest to educators considering the adoption of game-based learning and those seeking new learning cultures for EfS.\r\nPractical Implications: Game-based learning and teaching approaches can achieve a learner-centred active, collaborative learning environment that enhances student engagement with business sustainability.\r\nOriginality\/Value: Experiences gained from this study should assist others in the implementation of game-based learning to engage students in business sustainability.",

This game provides an alternative collaborative learning environment to the traditional instructivist approach in order to enrich Education for Sustainability learning experiences and enhance student engagement.\r\nDesign\/Methodology\/Approach: Students’ reflections on their game-based learning experiences and suggestions for game development were collected through a short qualitative survey. Results are explored through three frameworks, the Multifaceted Student Value Model, the Dimensions of Engagement Framework and the UK Higher Education Authority Framework for Engagement Through Partnership.\r\nFindings: Research findings suggest the Sustainable Strategies Game provides game-based learning within Education for Sustainability that delivers ‘edutainment’ within an active, collaborative and experiential learning environment that the students value. It is also able to challenge thinking and emotionally engage students with the fundamentals of business sustainability. Reflection-on-action and the students’ role as co-researchers in game development allow students to become active participants in their learning as well as knowledge producers and evaluators. These outcomes deliver the UK Higher Education Authority’s core facets of student engagement through partnership.\r\nResearch limitations\/implications: This practice-focused study presents the self-reported results of a one-time, small study which does not offer generalised, independently validated responses. However, the findings may be of interest to educators considering the adoption of game-based learning and those seeking new learning cultures for EfS.\r\nPractical Implications: Game-based learning and teaching approaches can achieve a learner-centred active, collaborative learning environment that enhances student engagement with business sustainability.\r\nOriginality\/Value: Experiences gained from this study should assist others in the implementation of game-based learning to engage students in business sustainability.",

      "rioxx2_description": "Objectives: The MEETINGDEM research project aimed to implement the combined Dutch Meeting Centre Support Programme (MCSP) for community-dwelling people with dementia and caregivers within Italy, Poland and UK and to assess whether comparable benefits were found in these countries as in the Netherlands.  \r\nMethod: Nine pilot Meeting Centres (MCs) participated (Italy-5, Poland-2, UK-2). Effectiveness of MCSP was compared to usual care (UC) on caregiver outcomes measuring competence (SSCQ), mental health (GHQ-12), emotional distress (NPI-Q) and loneliness (UCLA) analysed by ANCOVAs in a 6-month pre-test\/post-test controlled trial. Interviews using standardised measures were completed with caregivers.  \r\nResults: Pre\/post data were collected for 93 caregivers receiving MCSP and 74 receiving UC. No statistically significant differences on the outcome measures were found overall.  At a country level MC caregivers in Italy showed significant better general mental health (p=0.04, d=0.55) and less caregiver distress (p=0.02, d=0.62) at post-test than the UC group. Caregiver satisfaction was rated on a sample at 3 months (n=81) and 6 months (n=84). The majority of caregivers reported feeling less burdened and more supported by participating in MCSP.\r\nConclusion: The moderate positive effect on sense of competence and the greater mental health benefit for lonely caregivers using the MCSP compared to UC as found in the original Dutch studies were not replicated. However, subject to study limitations, caregivers in Italy using MCSP benefitted more regarding their mental health and emotional distress than caregivers using UC. Further evaluation of the benefits of MCSP within these countries in larger study samples is recommended.",

      "rioxx2_description": "With over two thirds of people with dementia living in the community and one third of those living alone, it is important to consider the future housing needs of this population, particularly as symptoms of cognitive impairment increase. Policy in England has focused on enabling people living with dementia to remain in their own homes for as long as possible, often with the support of a family carer. However, many people struggle to maintain an acceptable quality of life in their own homes as their dementia advances, often due to the design limitations of mainstream housing and the challenge of finding specialist domiciliary care that is affordable and of sufficient quality. Extra care housing (ECH) offers a model that aims to support older people living in their own apartments, while also offering specialist person-centred care as and when it is needed. This paper reports on a longitudinal project that explored how ECH can respond to the changing social care needs of residents, including those living with dementia. Participants included residents and staff from four ECH schemes, one of which was a specialist dementia scheme, in two regions of England. Interviews were carried with 51 residents across 4 rounds at 5 month intervals between October 2015 and June 2017. Interviews were also carried out with 7 managers, 20 care staff and 2 local authority commissioners of housing for older people.  Key factors included person-centred care and support, flexible commissioning and staffing, appropriate design of the environment and suitable location of the scheme within the wider community. The challenge of delivering services that addresses these issues during a period of reduced public spending is acknowledged. Further research is suggested to compare different approaches to supporting people with dementia, including integrated and separated accommodation, and different stages of dementia.",

Given the benefits of imagery on performance, and the lack of an appropriate wheelchair specific measure, the aim of this multi-study research programme was to develop a new psychometric tool to measure the vividness of movement imagery in wheelchair athletes. We used the Vividness of Movement Imagery Questionnaire–2 (VMIQ-2; Roberts, Callow, Hardy, Markland & Bringer, 2008) as a conceptual framework for item creation and subsequent development of a new tool known as the Wheelchair Imagery Ability Questionnaire (WIAQ).\r\n\r\nMethod: Study 1 focused on item creation for the WIAQ for the scale with a purposeful sample of wheelchair athletes using focus groups. Study 2 tested the factor structure of the WIAQ using a Bayesian Structural Equation Modelling (BSEM) approach. Study 3 provided concurrent validity of the WIAQ.\r\n\r\nResults: Study 1 resulted in the development of the initial 24 item WIAQ. Study 2 refined the scale through the use of BSEM to a 15 item measure. Study 3 provided support for the WIAQ evidence for the concurrent validity of the measure.\r\n\r\nConclusion: The WIAQ is the first known measure specifically created to measure imagery ability in wheelchair athletes and has scope to be used in a broader rehabilitation context for individuals and practitioners making use of imagery as a tool to support various physical recovery strategies.",

      "rioxx2_description": "The clinical comorbidity of alcohol dependence (AD) and\r\nmajor depressive disorder (MDD) is well established,\r\nwhereas genetic factors influencing co-occurrence remain\r\nunclear. A recent study using polygenic risk scores (PRS)\r\ncalculated based on the first-wave Psychiatric Genomics\r\nConsortium MDD meta-analysis (PGC-MDD1) suggests a\r\nmodest shared genetic contribution to MDD and AD. Using a\r\n(∼10 fold) larger discovery sample, we calculated PRS\r\nbased on the second wave (PGC-MDD2) of results, in a\r\nsevere AD case–control target sample. We found significant associations between AD disease status and MDD-PRS derived from both PGC-MDD2 (most informative\r\nP-threshold=1.0, P=0.00063, R2=0.533%) and PGCMDD1\r\n(P-threshold=0.2, P=0.00014, R2=0.663%) metaanalyses;\r\nthe larger discovery sample did not yield\r\nadditional predictive power. In contrast, calculating PRS in a MDD target sample yielded increased power when using\r\nPGC-MDD2 (P-threshold=1.0, P=0.000038, R2=1.34%)\r\nversus PGC-MDD1 (P-threshold=1.0, P=0.0013,\r\nR2=0.81%). Furthermore, when calculating PGC-MDD2\r\nPRS in a subsample of patients with AD recruited explicitly excluding comorbid MDD, significant associations were still found (n=331; P-threshold=1.0, P=0.042, R2=0.398%). Meanwhile, in the subset of patients in which MDD was not the explicit exclusion criteria, PRS predicted more variance (n=999; P-threshold=1.0, P=0.0003, R2=0.693%). Our findings replicate the reported genetic overlap between AD and MDD and also suggest the need for improved, rigorous phenotyping to identify true shared cross-disorder genetic factors. Larger target samples are needed to reduce noise and take advantage of increasing discovery sample size.",

Here, we tested whether ECT assignment\r\nand response\/nonresponse are associated with an increased genetic burden for major\r\ndepression (MD) using polygenic risk score (PRS), which summarize the contribution of diseaserelated\r\ncommon risk variants. Fifty-one psychiatric inpatients suffering from a major depressive\r\nepisode underwent ECT. MD-PRS were calculated for these inpatients and a separate\r\npopulation-based sample (n = 3,547 healthy; n = 426 self-reported depression) based on summary\r\nstatistics from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium MDD-working group (Cases:\r\nn = 59,851; Controls: n = 113,154). MD-PRS explained a significant proportion of disease status\r\nbetween ECT patients and healthy controls (p = .022, R2 = 1.173%); patients showed higher\r\nMD-PRS. MD-PRS in population-based depression self-reporters were intermediate between\r\nECT patients and controls (n.s.). Significant associations between MD-PRS and ECT response\r\n(50% reduction in Hamilton depression rating scale scores) were not observed. Our findings indicate\r\nthat ECT cohorts show an increased genetic burden for MD and are consistent with the\r\nhypothesis that treatment-resistant MD patients represent a subgroup with an increased genetic\r\nrisk for MD. Larger samples are needed to better substantiate these findings.",

This paper centralizes the experiences of four D\/deaf athletes who have competed in the Deaflympics and offers some insights about their socialization into sport. The key questions addressed are: (1) What are the key factors enabling D\/deaf athletes’ involvement and progression in elite D\/deaf sport? (2) What are the key challenges D\/deaf athletes face when participating and progressing in D\/deaf sport? Findings from the interviews suggest that early specialization into sport does not include exposure to Deaf sport. However, the athletes enthusiastically embraced Deaf sport, gaining an immense sense of achievement from these sporting endeavors. Interestingly, this outlook was often tempered because the athletes were aware of the ways in which Deaf sport is valued less than hearing sport. In concluding, we argue that sport practitioners need to promote D\/deafness through the merits of ‘deaf gain’ rather than considering D\/deafness as negative.",

Research in the discipline has historically used isolated variables, reporting generalised findings, which lack specific context. These studies are often outdated, reporting on performances, which occurred up to 10 years prior to publication. These problems may provide supporting evidence as to why coaches find it difficult to translate performance analysis research into practice. However, research in the discipline is shifting towards the generation of more meaningful data, increasing coaches’ use of research to inform their practices. In agreement with Prof Close’s comments, I have found athletes often value the findings from research more than coaches. Athletes, especially in team sports, want to secure their position or push other players out. These individuals appear more receptive to listening to and incorporating findings within their training. To further assist athletes and begin to encourage coaches to use research to support practice, I agree with the point made by Prof Close regarding the need for research training. Coach education provisions should include research training, yet athletes should also be provided with the opportunity to enhance their own knowledge and understanding. The combination of education and advancements in technology allows for a variety of platforms to be used to share the information, this can only benefit coaches, athletes and support staff practices and performances moving forward.",

Most studies conducted on local spatial and temporal variance of pollen concentrations are from one season. Only a few studies include multiple seasons and the results are inconclusive. The patterns and factors responsible for local spatial and temporal pollen variance are still largely unknown.

Typical fast edge detection approaches, such as the single threshold method, are expensive to achieve in unsupervised edge detection. This study proposes a Genetic Programming (GP) based algorithm to quickly and automatically extract binary edges in an unsupervised manner. We investigate how GP can effectively evolve an edge detector from a single image without ground truth, and whether the evolved edge detector can be directly applied to other unseen\/test images. The proposed method is examined and compared with a recent GP method and the Canny method on the Berkeley segmentation dataset. The results show that the proposed GP method has the ability to effectively evolve edge detectors by using only a single image as the whole training set, and significantly outperforms the two methods it is compared to. Furthermore, the binary edges detected by the evolved edge detectors have a good balance between recall and precision.",

      "rioxx2_description": "Levels of social support are strongly associated with health outcomes and inequalities. The use of lay health workers (LHWs) has been suggested by policy makers across the world as an intervention to identify risks to health and to promote health, particularly in disadvantaged communities. However, there have been few attempts to theorize the work undertaken by LHWs to understand how interventions work. In this article, the authors present the concept of 'synthetic socialsupport' and distinguish it from the work of health professionals or the spontaneous social support received from friends and family. The authors provide new empirical data to illustrate the concept based on qualitative, observational research, using a novel shadowing method involving clinical and non-clinical researchers, on the everyday work of 'pregnancy outreach workers' (POWs) in Birmingham, UK. The service was being evaluated as part of a randomized controlled trial. These LHWs provided instrumental, informational, emotional and appraisal support to the women they worked with, which are all key components of social support. The social support was 'synthetic' because it was distinct from the support embedded in spontaneous social networks: it was non-reciprocal; it was offered on a strictly time-limited basis; the LHWs were accountable for the relationship, and the social networks produced were targeted rather than spontaneous. The latter two qualities of this synthetic form of social support may have benefits over spontaneous networks by improving the opportunities for the cultivation of new relationships (both strong and weak ties) outside the women's existing spontaneous networks that can have a positive impact on them and by offering a reliable source of health information and support in a chaotic environment. The concept of SSS can help inform policy makers about how deploying lay workers may enable them to achieve desired outcomes, specify their programme theories and evaluate accordingly.

Face to face and telephone interviews were conducted and self-report forms completed by parents at four-time points: before discharge (T0), 2 weeks after discharge (T1), 8 weeks after discharge (T2) and after stage two surgery (T3). Interviews were transcribed verbatim before inductive thematic analysis\r\nResults: Parents were recruited over a 15-month period from 2013-2015. Twelve mothers and 4 fathers took part. The infants had functionally univentricular heart (left n=10, right n=1) and a systemic shunt dependent lesion, tetralogy of Fallot (n=1). Dynamic constructivist and constructionist social processes occurred for all parents, involving physical, physiological, psychological and cognitive elements within four ‘patterns of experience’, two of which ‘safety and security’ and ‘love and support’ are presented in this paper\r\nImplications: Parental support is essential; parents need to be engaged in discharge planning process and given the opportunity to express their needs to ensure that discharge care is truly patient and family centred.\r\nConclusions: Transition from hospital to home was complex and multi-faceted, with unanticipated physical and emotional transitions superimposed upon those that were expected.",

Participants’ experiences relating to the feasibility, acceptability and usability of the CHAT2 were explored by using the clinical scenarios to role play situations where parents and HCPs would need to use the CHAT2. The clinical scenarios with HCPs were video recorded with and audio recorded with parents. Participants were asked to feedback at the end of the scenarios (verbally and written), evaluating the CHAT2 for ease of use and suggestions for implementation in practice.\r\n\r\nFindings: Four themes emerged from the data analysis including: Suggestions for improved documentation; Aspects to consider during preparation and in dialogue with parents; Preparation of health care professionals; Communication\r\n\r\nConclusions: The project team need to focus on the preparation of a toolkit for HCPs so that everyone knows how to use the CHAT2.

However, this necessitates good discharge preparation to enable parents to develop appropriate knowledge and understanding of signs of deterioration to look for and who to contact.\r\nDesign This was a longitudinal qualitative feasibility study, within a constructivist paradigm. Parents were taught how to use the CHAT before taking their infant home and asked to participate in semi-structured interviews at four timepoints: before discharge [T0]; two weeks after discharge [T1], eight weeks after discharge [T2] and after stage two surgery [T3].

The large changes in anthropogenic emissions both within and outside Europe---especially since the beginning of the 1990s---led to a decrease in many air pollutants. The model analysis captured this observed trend. Using the EVA system (Economic Valuation of Air pollution) we were able to derive health impacts, showing (for the European modelling domain) that premature deaths in 2010 were less than half of the 1980 value. While the decrease was also determined for nitrogen compounds in general, the share of reduced nitrogen (NH3 and NH4+) increased---a result of both emission trends and atmospheric behavior. An experimental emission scenario applied to the model suite demonstrated further health improvements are possible for technically feasible measures to reduce ammonia emissions.",

Measurements at the inferior-umbilicus were, on average, 1.6 and 2.1 cm narrower than superior-umbilicus and umbilicus sites, respectively (p < 0.001).

Person-centred care is a marker of care quality; delivering such care is a goal of service improvement.\r\n\r\nObjectives:\r\nThe Person, Interactions and Environment (PIE) Programme comprises an observation tool and a systematic approach to implement and embed a person-centred approach in routine care for hospitalised patients with dementia. The study aims were to evaluate PIE as a method to improve the care of older people with dementia on acute hospital wards, and develop insight into what person-centred care might look like in practice in this setting.\r\n\r\nMethods:\r\nWe performed a longitudinal comparative case study design in 10 purposively selected wards in five trusts in three English regions, alongside an embedded process evaluation. Data were collected from multiple sources: staff, patients, relatives, organisational aggregate information and documents. Mixed methods were employed: ethnographic observation; interviews and questionnaires; patient case studies (patient observation and conversations ‘in the moment’, interviews with relatives and case records); and patient and ward aggregate data. Data were synthesised to create individual case studies of PIE implementation and outcomes in context of ward structure, organisation, patient profile and process of care delivery. A cross-case comparison facilitated a descriptive and explanatory account of PIE implementation in context, the pattern of variation, what shaped it and the consequences flowing from it. Quantitative data were analysed using simple descriptive statistics. A qualitative data analysis employed grounded theory methods.\r\n\r\nResults:\r\nThe study furthered the understanding of the dimensions of care quality for older people with dementia on acute hospital wards and the environmental, organisational and cultural factors that shaped delivery. Only two wards fully implemented PIE, sustaining and embedding change over 18 months. The remaining wards either did not install PIE (‘non-implementers’) or were ‘partial implementers’. The interaction between micro-level contextual factors [aspects of leadership (drivers, facilitators, team, networks), fit with strategic initiatives and salience with valued goals] and meso- and macro-level organisational factors were the main barriers to PIE adoption. Evidence suggests that the programme, where implemented, directly affected improvements in ward practice, with a positive impact on the experiences of patients and caregivers, although the heterogeneity of need and severity of impairment meant that some of the more visible changes did not affect everyone equally.\r\n\r\nLimitations:\r\nAlthough PIE has the potential to improve the care of people with dementia when implemented, findings are indicative only: data on clinical outcomes were not systematically collected, and PIE was not adopted on most study wards.\r\n\r\n\r\nResearch implications:\r\nFurther research is required to identify more precisely the skill mix and resources necessary to provide person-focused care to hospitalised people with dementia, across the spectrum of need, including those with moderate and severe impairment. Implementing innovations to change practices in complex organisations requires a more in-depth understanding of the contextual factors that have an impact on the capacity of organisations to absorb and embed new practices.",

      "rioxx2_description": "There is a growing belief in a rise in mental ill-health amongst HE students within the UK though there is little evidence that any rise is specific to this particular population (Macaskill, 2013). However there are significant risk factors to starting University which could act as contributory factors (Scanlon, Rowling and Weber, 2007). At the University of Worcester we have identified some evidence of increasing occurrences of mental distress, including a significant drop in retention at year 1 (level 4) in which mental difficulties have been reported as the main or a contributory factor. Mitigating circumstances claims for assessment which directly mention mental ill-health have also increased significantly. Anecdotally Academic Tutors are also reporting high levels of “crisis” levels mental ill-health amongst students, similar to that reported elsewhere (Association of University & College Counselling, 2011). Often academic tutors are only made aware of the issue through withdrawal, poor marks or a student in crisis, when it is usually too late to effectively act. On campus there is significant effort to signpost students to mental wellbeing services, including workshops, drop-in sessions, and counselling though the update amongst dance students is low. This remains the case even after specific referrals from academic staff. We theorise that stigma around mental ill-health remains a significant barrier to students accessing these services (Martin, 2010). Low-mid levels of mental distress do not seem sufficient to motivate students to overcome the perceived negative consequences of revealing their ill health. Students are very motivated by assessment (Coutts, Gilleard and Baglin, 2011). Over the last two years we have introduced some form of psychological self-assessment into the first-year dance modules. In order to encourage engagement, these exercises are part of summative assessment portfolio items. Students are asked to complete a series of dance-related psychological exercises drawn from Taylor and Estanol (2015) and self-assess their responses. By using an online notetaking tool (Microsoft OneNote) the lecturer has access to their responses immediately after completion. This allows direction towards psychological training\/support as part of the formative feedback process, as well as reframing the contents of taught sessions to directly address issues raised. By tracking these exercises over time students become more proficient at identifying their own mental health. This early intervention has been shown anecdotally to be effective in supporting students through the critical early days of their degree, and by integrating psychological awareness throughout these modules we encourage a greater sense of personal responsibility and openness about mental wellbeing. Engagement with the task was close to 100% and sharing exercises, in which coping strategies can be discussed through an anonymous shared online section, also saw very high levels of engagement. This is relevant as (Pinfold et al., 2005) suggest that peer sharing of experiences of mental health can help reduce stigma.",

For dance this information will typically include videos, photos, sketches, annotated Word\/pdf\/PowerPoint documents, web clips\/sites as well as written notes.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft OneNote is a powerful, cross-device app allowing exactly this kind note taking and, as such, offers fantastic opportunities for students to develop their ability to work with and make sense of diverse forms of electronic information. Its flexible nature allows students to work in a creative way that suits their own learning style.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft OneNote now has “class notebook” add-on which provides two additional key features: a central storage place for course material (laid out in notebook format) and a shared “common” space for students to share their work with each other. This can be incredibly useful for allowing both flipped and collaborative learning.\r\n\r\nWe have been trialling various features of OneNote within a portfolio learning environment at level 4 and 5 of a Dance course at the University of Worcester. An existing dance student was recruited to support this process. We had two aims: to develop students technical skills in handling and using information (as per JISC definition of digital literacy) and to create flexible learning and assessment environments.  We used it to deploy content and study tasks, review student work as it developed and provide feedback. Students also shared elements of their portfolio with others via the collaboration space in order to facilitate co-learning and peer review.\r\n\r\nThe feedback from both the lecturers and the students was very positive. The lecturers found they could look across all students’ work as it developed, allowing restructuring of learning during the module. It was also fast and easy to provide feed-forward feedback on the script to allow students to fully achieve in this assessment. \r\n\r\nThe students liked using OneNote with comments on the ease of adding in photos and videos, and how easy it was to organise their work. 60% agreed with the statement “Was looking at others work in the collaboration space helpful to assess the quality of your work?” and 92% preferred using OneNote to writing an essay. 40% felt using OneNote had improved their digital skills. \r\n\r\nWe saw a 67% continuation in using OneNote for assignments even when it was not a requirement. \r\n\r\nThis session will cover the potential benefits, and our experiences, of using OneNote and provide useful tips for educationalists considering this kind of environment.",

We used it to deploy content and study tasks, review student work as it developed and provide feedback. Students also shared elements of their portfolio with others via the collaboration space in order to facilitate co-learning and peer review.\r\n\r\nThe feedback from both the lecturers and the students was very positive. The lecturers found they could look across all students’ work as it developed, allowing restructuring of learning during the module. It was also fast and easy to provide feed-forward feedback on the script to allow students to fully achieve in this assessment. \r\n\r\nThe students liked using OneNote with comments on the ease of adding in photos and videos, and how easy it was to organise their work. 60% agreed with the statement “Was looking at others work in the collaboration space helpful to assess the quality of your work?” and 92% preferred using OneNote to writing an essay. 40% felt using OneNote had improved their digital skills. \r\n\r\nWe saw a 67% continuation in using OneNote for assignments even when it was not a requirement. \r\n\r\nThis session will cover the potential benefits, and our experiences, of using OneNote and provide useful tips for educationalists considering this kind of environment.",

      "rioxx2_description": "Background and Aims: The relationship of postpartum psychosis to other episodes of mania occurring outside the perinatal period among women with bipolar disorder is not well understood. Previous studies have used between‐subjects designs to compare the clinical presentations of these episodes making it difficult to draw conclusions. There are also inconsistencies in the findings. To overcome this, we have undertaken within‐subject comparisons of the clinical presentation of postpartum and non‐postpartum manic episodes in women with bipolar disorder.\r\n\r\nMethod: Participants were 53 women meeting DSM‐IV for bipolar I disorder recruited into the Bipolar Disorder Research Network (www.bdrn.org) where we had collected detailed symptom information on a postpartum episode of mania with onset within 6 weeks of childbirth and a comparison non‐postpartum manic episode The occurrence of a number manic, psychotic and depressive symptoms experienced in these episodes were compared.\r\n\r\nResults: Postpartum manic episodes had a significantly higher incidence of perplexity (P = .004) and visual hallucinations at trend level (P = .07). In comparison more classic manic symptoms specifically racing thoughts (P = .013), pressured speech (P = .013), distractibility (P = .019), increased self‐esteem (P = .017), reduced need for sleep (P = .049) and increased sociability (P = .023) were all significantly less likely to present in postpartum episodes.\r\n\r\nConclusion: Differences in the clinical presentation of postpartum and non‐postpartum manic episodes within the same woman possibly suggests specific factors involved in the aetiology of postpartum mania. Further research determining if differences in these clinical presentations do reflect differences in underlying aetiology is needed. These findings could lead to improved clinical management of postpartum psychosis in women with bipolar disorder.",

To overcome this, we have undertaken within‐subject comparisons of the clinical presentation of postpartum and non‐postpartum manic episodes in women with bipolar disorder.\r\n\r\nMethod: Participants were 53 women meeting DSM‐IV for bipolar I disorder recruited into the Bipolar Disorder Research Network (www.bdrn.org) where we had collected detailed symptom information on a postpartum episode of mania with onset within 6 weeks of childbirth and a comparison non‐postpartum manic episode The occurrence of a number manic, psychotic and depressive symptoms experienced in these episodes were compared.\r\n\r\nResults: Postpartum manic episodes had a significantly higher incidence of perplexity (P = .004) and visual hallucinations at trend level (P = .07). In comparison more classic manic symptoms specifically racing thoughts (P = .013), pressured speech (P = .013), distractibility (P = .019), increased self‐esteem (P = .017), reduced need for sleep (P = .049) and increased sociability (P = .023) were all significantly less likely to present in postpartum episodes.\r\n\r\nConclusion: Differences in the clinical presentation of postpartum and non‐postpartum manic episodes within the same woman possibly suggests specific factors involved in the aetiology of postpartum mania. Further research determining if differences in these clinical presentations do reflect differences in underlying aetiology is needed. These findings could lead to improved clinical management of postpartum psychosis in women with bipolar disorder.",

      "rioxx2_description": "Introduction : The role of long-distance transported (LDT) Ambrosia pollen in inducing new sensitization and affecting sensitization rates in Artemisia -sensitized patients is unclear. Aim : The aim of this study was to estimate the degree of cross-sensitization to Ambrosia \/ Artemisia allergens in citizens of Poznan (Western Poland). This area is covered by extensive Artemisia populations but does not currently have local Ambrosia populations. Material and methods : Sera of 119 patients were tested by fluoroenzyme immunoassay (CAP-FEIA system) against pollen allergen extracts of Artemisia vulgaris and Ambrosia artemisiifolia , an allergenic component of A. vulgaris (nArt v 1), and an allergenic component of A. artemisiifolia ( nAmb a 1 ). Skin prick tests (SPTs, n = 86) were performed with pollen allergen extracts of A. vulgaris and A. artemisiifolia . Artemisia and Ambrosia pollen in ambient air was collected (1996â��2013) by a Hirst type volumetric trap sited at roof level (33 m). Results : The SPT showed that the prevalence of sensitization to Ambrosia and Artemisia pollen exceeded 3.5, and 10.5, respectively. The measurements of IgE in blood serum (CAP-FEIA) revealed that among Ambrosia -sensitized patients 90.1 (20\/22 patients) were concomitantly sensitized to Artemisia . 59.1 (13\/22) of these patients reacted to nArt v 1, suggesting primary sensitization to Artemisia pollen.

      "abstract": "Introduction : The role of long-distance transported (LDT) Ambrosia pollen in inducing new sensitization and affecting sensitization rates in Artemisia -sensitized patients is unclear. Aim : The aim of this study was to estimate the degree of cross-sensitization to Ambrosia \/ Artemisia allergens in citizens of Poznan (Western Poland). This area is covered by extensive Artemisia populations but does not currently have local Ambrosia populations. Material and methods : Sera of 119 patients were tested by fluoroenzyme immunoassay (CAP-FEIA system) against pollen allergen extracts of Artemisia vulgaris and Ambrosia artemisiifolia , an allergenic component of A. vulgaris (nArt v 1), and an allergenic component of A. artemisiifolia ( nAmb a 1 ). Skin prick tests (SPTs, n = 86) were performed with pollen allergen extracts of A. vulgaris and A. artemisiifolia . Artemisia and Ambrosia pollen in ambient air was collected (1996â��2013) by a Hirst type volumetric trap sited at roof level (33 m). Results : The SPT showed that the prevalence of sensitization to Ambrosia and Artemisia pollen exceeded 3.5, and 10.5, respectively. The measurements of IgE in blood serum (CAP-FEIA) revealed that among Ambrosia -sensitized patients 90.1 (20\/22 patients) were concomitantly sensitized to Artemisia . 59.1 (13\/22) of these patients reacted to nArt v 1, suggesting primary sensitization to Artemisia pollen. Only 2 (9.1) patients were mono-sensitized to Ambrosia pollen extract, but surprisingly not to nAmb a 1 . Conclusions : The LDT Ambrosia pollen had a negligible effect on the rate of sensitization to Ambrosia allergens in Poznan and did not increase the prevalence of sensitization to Artemisia pollen in this region. However, the majority of patients showing hypersensitization to Artemisia pollen might also present symptoms during elevated episodes of LDT of Ambrosia pollen.",

      "rioxx2_description": "Hostage and crisis negotiators serve a vital function within modern-day policing and can play a role in whether individuals live or die.

Additionally, the oak allergen (Que a 1) is listed as one of the eight major Bet v 1 allergens of the Fagales and is considered a moderate cause of pollinosis.

Season characteristics in terms of magnitude of pollen peaks, annual pollen sum together with onset and length of season were calculated. Furthermore, four common definitions of the season onset were tested and a generalized phenological model based on thermal time (growing degree day, GDD) was applied to predict the onset of the pollen season.\r\n\r\nResult\r\nThe most accurate definition for a European-wide description of the start of the oak pollen season was found to be the cumulative daily pollen concentrations above 50 grains m3. GDD thresholds for the start of the pollen season varied between sites and followed a decreasing gradient from south to north, with some exceptions. 73% of the model calculations for onset of the season showed a difference of four days or less compared to the observed onset of the season when a base temperature of 2°C was used. \r\n\r\nHigh levels of oak pollen were often recorded in Spain (total annual sum: ~5000-17000 grains); this was also the site with the comparatively longest oak pollen seasons (~2.5 months) and several different oak species dominating the area. Northern sites generally presented lower pollen levels (total annual sum: ~ 300-3800 grains) and shorter seasons (~ 0.5-1 month) with only two dominant species (Q.petraea and Q.robur). \r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nThe work presented in our study will increase the understanding of oak pollen variation in Europe and provide knowledge of its phenology, which is a critical aspect for modelling purposes. The general model approach used can be implemented in other areas where pollen observations are non-existent.",

      "rioxx2_description": "Background: Strength and conditioning (S&C) is a key part of athletic development. This has led to an increase in the number of people who seek employment in the field. Sports Coach UK (2013) data reveal that approximately 69% of all coaches are men with the remaining 31% being women, only 18% of which are qualified coaches. Evidently, female coaches are under-represented in S&C, especially at the elite-level. Lack of experience, family conflicts, high expectations and discrimination have been identified as reasons for lack of women in coaching and S&C positions. However, anecdotal evidence suggests that there has been an increase of women in S&C during the last two decades. Despite this upsurge in numbers, there is still a paucity of evidence in regard to women’s experiences of\/barriers in advancing in S&C. Therefore, the aim of this research is to explore perceptions & attitudes towards becoming a female S&C coach in predominantly male dominated sports and to identify the reasons why female coaches are marginalised in the sector. Methods: To explore this lacuna, we have carried out an exploratory study using one-on-one semi-structured interviews conducted with female S&C coaches in key positions, working in elite sports. A snowball sampling method was used to recruit participants. All participants have had significant S&C experience and have worked with both male and female athletes. Voice data was analysed through thematic coding and key themes identified which form the spine of the discussion. Findings: Participants noted three main challenges that they, as S&C coaches, have faced. Those include: institutional politics, marginalisation and impression management of gender identity. All of these acted as barriers to reaching higher positions of leadership or to secure S&C positions in other sports. Discussion: This study advances knowledge by increasing our understanding of the socio-cultural challenges women in S&C positions encounter and have to overcome to prove to be as competent and effective as their male counterparts.",

      "abstract": "Background: Strength and conditioning (S&C) is a key part of athletic development. This has led to an increase in the number of people who seek employment in the field. Sports Coach UK (2013) data reveal that approximately 69% of all coaches are men with the remaining 31% being women, only 18% of which are qualified coaches. Evidently, female coaches are under-represented in S&C, especially at the elite-level. Lack of experience, family conflicts, high expectations and discrimination have been identified as reasons for lack of women in coaching and S&C positions. However, anecdotal evidence suggests that there has been an increase of women in S&C during the last two decades. Despite this upsurge in numbers, there is still a paucity of evidence in regard to women’s experiences of\/barriers in advancing in S&C. Therefore, the aim of this research is to explore perceptions & attitudes towards becoming a female S&C coach in predominantly male dominated sports and to identify the reasons why female coaches are marginalised in the sector. Methods: To explore this lacuna, we have carried out an exploratory study using one-on-one semi-structured interviews conducted with female S&C coaches in key positions, working in elite sports. A snowball sampling method was used to recruit participants. All participants have had significant S&C experience and have worked with both male and female athletes. Voice data was analysed through thematic coding and key themes identified which form the spine of the discussion. Findings: Participants noted three main challenges that they, as S&C coaches, have faced. Those include: institutional politics, marginalisation and impression management of gender identity. All of these acted as barriers to reaching higher positions of leadership or to secure S&C positions in other sports. Discussion: This study advances knowledge by increasing our understanding of the socio-cultural challenges women in S&C positions encounter and have to overcome to prove to be as competent and effective as their male counterparts.",

Participants were asked to identify an HRD issue for the future and then pose questions that placed surprise up front and that could indicate a vulnerability for HRD. Two scenarios are developed for the year 2028 and events leading to this year. In the first, S1, human behaviour within organizations is defined by machines and machines prescribe why, what and where work is needed, who does it, when, and how work is done. Thus programmes of learning are pre-determined by machines. In the second, S2, aritificial intelligence proves to be incapable of adapting to the extreme events of solar activity affecting satellites and internet communications globally. HRD rebuilds trust in the collective human ability to work together collaboratively to restore a team ethic and rebuild. The scenarios are discussed and a recommendation is made for HRD research to consider the direction and value of their work and how progress in academic life might be reconstituted to allow more attention to be given to key areas of machine learning and artificial intelligence.",

It is unclear however, how such variations impact on the policing of gun enabled crime. By using qualitative data generated from interviews with police, policy and decision makers from thirteen European countries, the authors of this article aim to determine how stakeholders perceive that national variations in firearms legislation impact on the policing of gun enabled crime within and across EU countries. Four main themes were identified from the qualitative data: disparities in Legislation, disparities in Priority given and the Resources allocated to investigations into gun enabled crime as well as\r\nInterventions. Due to the aforementioned disparities, cross-national investigations into incidents of gun crime are at risk of remaining impaired in their effectiveness. Therefore, more legislative coherency as well as sustainable long-term interventions will be needed to\r\nsuccessfully reduce ownership and use of firearms in the criminal world. In this context, a departure from an exclusive use of an economic model of gun crime is recommended to allow for a better understanding of the dynamics of the black gun market.",

      "rioxx2_description": "Despite the existence of well-established international environmental and nature conservation policies (e.g., the Ramsar Convention and Convention on Biological Diversity) ponds are largely missing from national and international legislation and policy frameworks. Ponds are among the most biodiverse and ecologically important freshwater habitats, and their value lies not only in individual ponds, but more importantly, in networks of ponds (pondscapes). Ponds make an important contribution to society through the ecosystem services they provide, with effective conservation of pondscapes essential to ensuring that these services are maintained. Implementation of current pond conservation through individual site designations does not function at the landscape scale, where ponds contribute most to biodiversity. Conservation and management of pondscapes should complement current national and international nature conservation and water policy\/legislation, as pondscapes can provide species protection in landscapes where large-scale traditional conservation areas cannot be established (e.g., urban or agricultural landscapes). We propose practical steps for the effective incorporation or enhancement of ponds within five policy areas: through open water sustainable urban drainage systems in urban planning, increased incentives in agri-environment schemes, curriculum inclusion in education, emphasis on ecological scale in mitigation measures following anthropogenic developments, and the inclusion of pondscapes in conservation policy.",

      "abstract": "Despite the existence of well-established international environmental and nature conservation policies (e.g., the Ramsar Convention and Convention on Biological Diversity) ponds are largely missing from national and international legislation and policy frameworks. Ponds are among the most biodiverse and ecologically important freshwater habitats, and their value lies not only in individual ponds, but more importantly, in networks of ponds (pondscapes). Ponds make an important contribution to society through the ecosystem services they provide, with effective conservation of pondscapes essential to ensuring that these services are maintained. Implementation of current pond conservation through individual site designations does not function at the landscape scale, where ponds contribute most to biodiversity. Conservation and management of pondscapes should complement current national and international nature conservation and water policy\/legislation, as pondscapes can provide species protection in landscapes where large-scale traditional conservation areas cannot be established (e.g., urban or agricultural landscapes). We propose practical steps for the effective incorporation or enhancement of ponds within five policy areas: through open water sustainable urban drainage systems in urban planning, increased incentives in agri-environment schemes, curriculum inclusion in education, emphasis on ecological scale in mitigation measures following anthropogenic developments, and the inclusion of pondscapes in conservation policy.",

      "rioxx2_description": "Intermittent rivers are temporally dynamic, shifting between lotic, lentic (ponding) and dry habitat phases, yet almost all research effort has focussed on the lotic phase, with limited research attention on the lentic and dry phases. Information regarding the biological diversity of the lentic phase is vital to quantify the total aquatic biodiversity, their use as flow refugia, and the long-term conservation and management of intermittent rivers. In this study, we compared the diversity and composition of macroinvertebrates from perennial, intermittent and ponded sites in two intermittent rivers in the United Kingdom. We examined whether instream ponding provided refugia for lotic taxa and a habitat for newly colonising taxa. A total of 129 taxa (perennial - 86, intermittent - 82, ponding - 78) were recorded. Instream ponds were found to support heterogeneous communities compared to flowing sites. Twenty-two percent of taxa were recorded only from ponded sites, many of which were lentic specialists, while 38% of taxa persisted in instream ponds after flow had ceased. Results from this study highlight that instream ponds provide an important flow refuge for macroinvertebrates including rheophilic taxa, which move into instream ponds when channels become longitudinally disconnected, and makes a significant contribution to aquatic diversity in intermittent rivers, providing suitable habitat for newly colonising taxa. Aquatic diversity in intermittent rivers may have been underestimated historically, failing to acknowledge the ecological contribution of the lentic phase. Incorporating the ponding phase alongside the lotic phase will ensure the total aquatic biodiversity of intermittent rivers is quantified and effective biodiversity conservation and management strategies are employed.",

      "rioxx2_description": "Recently the human cytosolic branched-chain amino transferase (BCAT1) has been implicated in the development of myeloid leukaemia. Previously studies identified a redox active CXXC motif for BCAT1 analogous to the mitochondrial isoform (BCAT2). Oxidation of this CXXC motif can regulate aminotransferase activity in both isoforms. Interestingly the reduction mid-point potential (Em) of the BCAT1 CXXC motif is around 80mV lower compared with BCAT2. This suggests that the BCAT1 CXXC motif is more reducing in nature i.e. has antioxidant capacity. Further evidence to support this notion comes from the observation that BCAT1 is significantly less sensitive to inactivation mediated by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). This is an important observation, since H2O2 is a reactive oxygen species (ROS) implicated in myeloid leukaemia development. Here we provide the first evidence to show that the BCAT1 CXXC can metabolise H2O2. By using CXXC motif mutant constructs, we also evaluate the role of the BCAT1 CXXC motif in myeloid leukaemia cells.\r\n\r\nTo investigate the antioxidant capacity of the BCAT1 CXXC motif, cDNA (accession NM_001178094.1) was cloned into a pET28a vector for overexpression and purification in E.coli BL21(DE3) cells. Site directed mutagenesis of the CXXC motif subsequently followed creating three constructs: 1) BCAT1-WT (unmutated), 2) BCAT1-CXXS (C-terminal Cys → Ser mutant) and 3) BCAT1-SXXS (N\/C-terminal Cys → Ser double mutant). Mutation of the BCAT1 CXXC motif was confirmed at the protein level by 5,5'-ditho-bis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) titration. WT and CXXC motif mutant BCAT1 protein was added to 5mM H2O2 & monitored at λ240nm for the disappearance of H2O2. This was compared with 1U of catalase as a positive control. Our data show that 15μg of purified BCAT1-WT could metabolise H2O2 at a rate of 0.14±0.02 μmol\/min. The BCAT1 CXXC motif mutants lacked capacity to do this. To verify our findings, BCAT1-WT treated with N-ethylmaleimide also lost the capacity to metabolise H2O2. This confirms that the antioxidant activity observed is Cys mediated. This novel finding for the BCAT1 CXXC motif may therefore be important in myeloid leukaemia development.\r\n\r\nTo evaluate the BCAT1 CXXC motif in myeloid leukaemia cells, WT and CXXS mutant BCAT1 was subcloned into a pLENTI-C-Myc-DDK lentiviral vector prior to transduction of U937 cells. Empty vector (EV) control transgenic U937 cells were also generated. Stable expression of BCAT1 was achieved and confirmed by western-blot and qPCR; BCAT1-WT (6.5±1.7 fold increase) & BCAT1-CXXS (5.1±2.6 fold increase). The BCAT1 and EV transgenic U937 cells were subjected to H2O2 mediated oxidative stress and monitored for cell viability after 24h. A significant difference in the LD50 between BCAT1-WT, BCAT1-CXXS and EV control cells was observed; 620±28mM, 306±37mM, 251±26mM respectively (p<0.05). This finding suggests that the BCAT1 CXXC provides protection against H2O2 mediated cell death. To corroborate these findings, the same cells treated with rotenone observed a similar pattern in LD50; 1.05mM, 0.06mM, 0.12mM respectively.\r\n\r\nROS are implicated in many cellular processes, including differentiation. Thus, we next asked whether the BCAT1 CXXC motif could suppress U937 cell differentiation mediated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). This compound was selected since ROS feature in PMA mediated differentiation. U937 cells were monitored for the expression of CD11b and CD36 following 48h PMA incubation. Our data show a significant reduction in the frequency of CD11b+\/CD36+ U937 cells for BCAT1-WT (17.5±6.9%) compared with EV controls (54.0±10.5%, p<0.05). BCAT1-CXXS also showed a reduction (30.6±4.9%), but not to the same extent as BCAT1-WT. This finding was mirrored by the expression level of CD11b, where the MFI was significantly less for BCAT1-WT (88.0±16.3) compared with EV control (251.5±54.7, p<0.001) and BCAT1-CXXS (152.5±6.3, p<0.05). Analysis of intracellular ROS using 2′,7′-Dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate revealed a reduction in cellular ROS for BCAT1-WT cells (5929±13.8 MFI), compared with EV controls (8527±196 MFI) and BCAT1-CXXS (7879±18.4 MFI). This shows that the BCAT1 CXXC motif may control cellular ROS levels in myeloid leukaemia cells.\r\n\r\nIn summary, this study identifies a novel antioxidant role for the BCAT1 CXXC which confers protection against ROS mediated cell death and differentiation of myeloid leukaemia cells.",

      "rioxx2_description": "Introduction: Taking into consideration the severity and risks associat¬ed with obesity, alternatives treatment strategies are highly necessary and Ginkgo biloba extract (GbE) has been investigated as a non-conventional therapy. Our laboratory has previously demonstrated that GbE treatment reduced body adiposity and fatty depot mass on diet-induced obese rats. However, it is unknown the mechanism of action involved with positive effects of GbE. In view of the above considerations, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of GbE on gene and protein expression of pro¬teins involved in lipolysis and de novo synthesis of fatty acids on epididy¬mal adipose fat pad in obese rats. \r\nMethods: Male rats were fed from 2 to 4-mo-old with high fat diet and thereafter treated for 14 days with 500mg\/kg of GbE (HFD+GbE) or sa¬line (HFD). NFD group was control group and received normal fat-diet during all the period and saline during treatment. Rats were euthanized and epididymal fat depot was removed. Gene expression of ATGL, HSL, Perilipin, FAS, ap2, SSEBP and PPARγ were evaluated by RT-PCR and Western blotting was used to FAS protein expression levels. \r\nResults: Both HFD and HFD+GbE groups reduced food\/energy intake in comparison to NFD group (45.1% and 50.0%, respectively, p = 0.001). HF¬D+GbE also fairly decreased food\/energy intake comparing to HFD (8.8%, p = 0.01). Perilipin gene expression was increased by 335%(p = 0.03) in HFD in comparison to NFD, while HFD+GbE was reduced by 95.2% in comparison to HFD (p = 0.01). Gene expression of FAS also decreased 70.7% in HFD+GbE in comparison to NFD (p = 0.02). Besides decreasing gene expression, the protein expression of FAS was reduced by 38% in HFD+GbE group in comparison to NFD group (p = 0.03). \r\nConclusion: GbE decreased gene and protein expression of important proteins involved in two metabolic process: lipolysis and de novo synthe¬sis of fatty acids. This allows us to suggest GbE might be investigated as an antiobesogenic therapy, since positive results have been observed. It is important to note that the GbE effects were observed in rats kept feeding with high fat diet. The data suggest that GbE might have potential as a therapy to treat obesity and its comorbidities, especially for obese subjects resistant to adhere to a nutritional education program.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Taking into consideration the severity and risks associat¬ed with obesity, alternatives treatment strategies are highly necessary and Ginkgo biloba extract (GbE) has been investigated as a non-conventional therapy. Our laboratory has previously demonstrated that GbE treatment reduced body adiposity and fatty depot mass on diet-induced obese rats. However, it is unknown the mechanism of action involved with positive effects of GbE. In view of the above considerations, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of GbE on gene and protein expression of pro¬teins involved in lipolysis and de novo synthesis of fatty acids on epididy¬mal adipose fat pad in obese rats. \r\nMethods: Male rats were fed from 2 to 4-mo-old with high fat diet and thereafter treated for 14 days with 500mg\/kg of GbE (HFD+GbE) or sa¬line (HFD). NFD group was control group and received normal fat-diet during all the period and saline during treatment. Rats were euthanized and epididymal fat depot was removed. Gene expression of ATGL, HSL, Perilipin, FAS, ap2, SSEBP and PPARγ were evaluated by RT-PCR and Western blotting was used to FAS protein expression levels. \r\nResults: Both HFD and HFD+GbE groups reduced food\/energy intake in comparison to NFD group (45.1% and 50.0%, respectively, p = 0.001). HF¬D+GbE also fairly decreased food\/energy intake comparing to HFD (8.8%, p = 0.01). Perilipin gene expression was increased by 335%(p = 0.03) in HFD in comparison to NFD, while HFD+GbE was reduced by 95.2% in comparison to HFD (p = 0.01). Gene expression of FAS also decreased 70.7% in HFD+GbE in comparison to NFD (p = 0.02). Besides decreasing gene expression, the protein expression of FAS was reduced by 38% in HFD+GbE group in comparison to NFD group (p = 0.03). \r\nConclusion: GbE decreased gene and protein expression of important proteins involved in two metabolic process: lipolysis and de novo synthe¬sis of fatty acids. This allows us to suggest GbE might be investigated as an antiobesogenic therapy, since positive results have been observed. It is important to note that the GbE effects were observed in rats kept feeding with high fat diet. The data suggest that GbE might have potential as a therapy to treat obesity and its comorbidities, especially for obese subjects resistant to adhere to a nutritional education program.",

      "rioxx2_title": "Effect of a 2-week Joint Mobilisation on Range of Motion in Those With Chronic Ankle Instability",
      "rioxx2_description": "Introduction: Injury to the lateral ligament complex of the ankle manifesting as ankle sprains are the most frequently incurred musculoskeletal injury [1]. Up to 70% of those who sustain a single lateral ankle sprain report residual symptoms, including recurrent bouts of instability, additional ankle sprains and reduced functional capacity [2]. These negative antecedents form the primary characteristics of chronic ankle instability (CAI), which although often considered an innocuous injury, has been associated with an increased risk of developing co-morbidities such as post-traumatic ankle osteoarthritis. CAI has been linked to many mechanical insufficiencies including reductions in posterior talar glide and dorsiflexion range of motion (DF-ROM). Joint mobilisation techniques that target the posterior glide of the talus are purported to increase DF-ROM through the restoration of arthrokinematic movements that occur between the talus and ankle mortise. Although joint mobilisations are informed by a conceptual framework of clinical reasoning, there is a lack of consensus within the literature regarding their effectiveness as a clinical technique. Further, there is a paucity of methodologically rigorous research into the interaction between treatment dose and ROM improvements [3]. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of different treatment durations of a grade IV anteroposterior talocrural joint mobilisation on weight-bearing DF-ROM (WB DF-ROM) during a 2-week treatment intervention. \r\n\r\nMethods: Forty-eight female team sports athletes (age = 22.8 ±4.8 years) participated in the study. All participants presented with a history of ankle instability which was confirmed using the Cumberland Ankle Instability Tool (CAIT), where a score of less than 24 was used to indicate the presence of the condition. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three treatment conditions (30 seconds, 60 seconds, or 120 seconds), and received six treatments equally spaced over a 2-week period. WB DF-ROM was measured prior to and immediately following each treatment session using the weight bearing lunge test and knee-to-wall principle. Two-way mixed model ANOVA was used to test for differences in WB DF-ROM between groups. Simple main effects were calculated to determine the difference between treatment groups following each treatment session. Effect size statistics were calculated using Hedge’s g. \r\n\r\nResults: Statistically significant interaction effects between the treatment group and treatment session for WB DF-ROM (F (17.042, 306.754) = 6.954, p ≤ 0.001, partial η2 = .279, έ = 0.682) were evidenced (Table 1). A significantly greater improvement in WB DF-ROM was observed in the 120 second treatment group compared to the 30 second group following treatment sessions 1, 2 and 3 (p ≤ 0.001). Longer treatment durations were seen to produce significantly greater improvements in WB DF-ROM than lesser durations following treatment session 2 and 3 (p ≤ 0.001). No significant differences were observed between treatment groups following treatment session 4, 5 or 6 (p ≥ 0.05). Effect size statistics showed that there was a ‘very large’ (g ≥ 1.2) effect for the 60 second treatment group following treatment session 1, and for the 30 second treatment group following treatment session 2. All other effect sizes were ‘huge’ (g ≥ 2.0).\r\n\r\nConclusions: These results indicate that an anteroposterior talar joint mobilisation is able to improve measures of WB DF-ROM in females with CAI regardless of treatment duration, whilst increases in treatment durations confer greater improvements during the first 3 application sessions. Consequently, longer treatment durations should be utilised early on in the treatment process to address ankle range of motion deficits.\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n1.\tFong DT, Hong Y, Chan LK, Yung PS, Chan KM.

      "rioxx2_description": "Background: Physical activity (PA) interventions for the promotion of weight-management may benefit from\r\nincreased choice and flexibility to overcome commonly-perceived barriers to PA. The aim of this study was to\r\ninvestigate the effects of a novel “points-based” approach to PA on body composition in inactive women, who\r\nare overweight or obese.\r\nMethods: Seventy-six overweight or obese, inactive women were randomly allocated to one of three conditions:\r\n‘Points-based’ PA (PBPA; 30 “PA points”•week− 1), Structured exercise (StructEx; 150 min moderate-intensity\r\nexercise•week− 1) or control (CONT; continue habitual inactive lifestyle) for a 24-week intervention. PA points for\r\nactivities were adapted from MET values, and 30 points was equivalent to 150 min of brisk walking. Measures of\r\nbody composition (dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry) and anthropometry were obtained at weeks 0, 4, 12 and 24.\r\nSelf-report activities were recorded weekly, with objective measures of PA (tri-axial accelerometry) and self-report\r\nmeasures of food intake obtained at weeks 0 and 24.\r\nResults: Fifty-eight women completed the study and provided data for primary outcomes. Of these, n = 41 and\r\nn = 19 provided data for food intake and objectively assessed PA. Mixed-design ANOVAs demonstrated that those\r\nin PBPA achieved a significant weight-loss at 24 weeks of − 3.3 ± 5.9 kg (− 3.4 ± 7.1%, p = 0.004). Waist circumference\r\nwas reduced in PBPA at 24 weeks (− 2.8 ± 4.6 cm), compared with CONT (+ 2.1 ± 6.6 cm, p = 0.024). There was a trend\r\nfor greater reductions in fat mass for those in PBPA vs. CONT (− 2.3 ± 4.6 kg vs. + 0.1 ± 2.0 kg, p = 0.075). Android fat\r\nwas reduced in PBPA at both 12 weeks (− 6.1 ± 12.6%, p = 0.005) and 24 weeks (− 10.1 ± 18.4%, p = 0.005), while\r\nthere was a trend for greater reductions in visceral adipose tissue in PBPA (− 5.8 ± 26.0%) vs. CONT at\r\n24 weeks (+ 7.8 ± 18.3%, p = 0.053). Body composition, body weight and waist circumference were unchanged\r\nin StructEx. There were trends for increases in light-activity and reductions in sedentary time in PBPA. There\r\nwas a trend for a reduction in daily energy intake of − 445 ± 564 kcal (p = 0.074), and a significant reduction\r\nin daily fat intake (p = 0.042) in PBPA.\r\nConclusion: A “points-based” approach to physical activity appears to be an effective strategy for inducing modest\r\nreductions in body weight and body fat in inactive women with overweight and obesity.",

      "abstract": "Background: Physical activity (PA) interventions for the promotion of weight-management may benefit from\r\nincreased choice and flexibility to overcome commonly-perceived barriers to PA. The aim of this study was to\r\ninvestigate the effects of a novel “points-based” approach to PA on body composition in inactive women, who\r\nare overweight or obese.\r\nMethods: Seventy-six overweight or obese, inactive women were randomly allocated to one of three conditions:\r\n‘Points-based’ PA (PBPA; 30 “PA points”•week− 1), Structured exercise (StructEx; 150 min moderate-intensity\r\nexercise•week− 1) or control (CONT; continue habitual inactive lifestyle) for a 24-week intervention. PA points for\r\nactivities were adapted from MET values, and 30 points was equivalent to 150 min of brisk walking. Measures of\r\nbody composition (dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry) and anthropometry were obtained at weeks 0, 4, 12 and 24.\r\nSelf-report activities were recorded weekly, with objective measures of PA (tri-axial accelerometry) and self-report\r\nmeasures of food intake obtained at weeks 0 and 24.\r\nResults: Fifty-eight women completed the study and provided data for primary outcomes. Of these, n = 41 and\r\nn = 19 provided data for food intake and objectively assessed PA. Mixed-design ANOVAs demonstrated that those\r\nin PBPA achieved a significant weight-loss at 24 weeks of − 3.3 ± 5.9 kg (− 3.4 ± 7.1%, p = 0.004). Waist circumference\r\nwas reduced in PBPA at 24 weeks (− 2.8 ± 4.6 cm), compared with CONT (+ 2.1 ± 6.6 cm, p = 0.024). There was a trend\r\nfor greater reductions in fat mass for those in PBPA vs. CONT (− 2.3 ± 4.6 kg vs. + 0.1 ± 2.0 kg, p = 0.075). Android fat\r\nwas reduced in PBPA at both 12 weeks (− 6.1 ± 12.6%, p = 0.005) and 24 weeks (− 10.1 ± 18.4%, p = 0.005), while\r\nthere was a trend for greater reductions in visceral adipose tissue in PBPA (− 5.8 ± 26.0%) vs. CONT at\r\n24 weeks (+ 7.8 ± 18.3%, p = 0.053). Body composition, body weight and waist circumference were unchanged\r\nin StructEx. There were trends for increases in light-activity and reductions in sedentary time in PBPA. There\r\nwas a trend for a reduction in daily energy intake of − 445 ± 564 kcal (p = 0.074), and a significant reduction\r\nin daily fat intake (p = 0.042) in PBPA.\r\nConclusion: A “points-based” approach to physical activity appears to be an effective strategy for inducing modest\r\nreductions in body weight and body fat in inactive women with overweight and obesity.",

      "rioxx2_description": "Objective to examine the current level of understanding held by midwives regarding the NICE physical activity guidelines in the UK, and to investigate the physical activity guidance given to women during pregnancy. Design an 11 question online survey comprising of a mixture of closed and open ended questions. Setting data reflects participants sampled across the United Kingdom. Participants fifty-nine midwives completed the online survey Measurements and findings an electronic survey was used to explore the midwives understanding of physical activity guidelines during pregnancy, and the advice they offered to women in their care. Qualitative content analysis was used to gain a more in-depth understanding of midwife knowledge. Two per cent of midwives correctly identified the physical activity guidelines, with 44 giving partially correct responses, 25 giving incorrect responses and 29 unsure of what the guidelines are. Despite the low level of correct responses, 59 of respondents reported they were confident or very confident in answering questions regarding physical activity. Only 4 of respondents reported having access to continual professional development (CPD) in the area of PA guidance. Key conclusions there appears to be a misplaced confidence amongst midwives in their knowledge of the NICE PA guidelines for pregnancy. Implications for practice as physical inactivity can be detrimental for the health of both mother and baby, there is a clear need for better dissemination of the current and future NICE physical activity guidelines in primary health care settings. The current study determined a substantial lack of CPD in the area of PA guidance, which may be a contributing factor to the lack of knowledge of the guidelines. As such, increasing CPD may in turn improve the accuracy of the advice given to pregnant women and consequently benefit the health of both mother and baby. Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd",

What must take place, it asserts, is the creation of nothing less than an ‘ecological citizenship’. To describe how this might be brought about, the encyclical employs the theological language of ‘conversion’. However, the rationale for this suggestion, and the implications it would entail for the way in which educational programmes on the environment might be pursued, is developed only minimally in the encyclical itself. The objective of this article is to take up and develop this hint by offering some philosophical and theological perspectives on the idea of human motivation towards care for the environment, and by exploring the current state of affairs in environmental education in light of it.

Fungal cultures without Bacillus plugs were used as controls. Similarly, assays were also performed with the cell-free culture supernatant of the bacteria that were grown in broth for 24, 48 and 72h. Supernatant was filtered through 0.22µm membranes and filtrates were used for antimicrobial activity. Filtrates (100µl) were normalised using Bradford assay, spread over the media, and one plug of the fungus was placed over the medium. The B. subtilis strain EU07 showed the highest inhibition of fungal growth in both plug and filtrate tests, followed by QST713 and FZB24.

      "rioxx2_description": "Species are often controlled by biotic factors such as competition at the warm edge of their distribution range. Disturbances at the treeline, disrupting competitive dominance, may thus enable alpine species to utilize lower altitudes. We searched for evidence for range expansion in grazed, fire‐managed Ethiopian subalpine Erica heathlands across a 25‐year chronosequence. We examined vascular plant composition in 48 plots (5 × 5 m) across an altitudinal range of 3,465–3,711 m.a.s.l. and analyzed how community composition changed in relation to increasing competition over time (using a Shade index based on Erica shrub height and cover) and altitude. Species‘ habitats and altitudinal ranges were derived from literature. Time since fire explained more variation (r2 = .41) in species composition than altitude did (r2 = .32) in an NMDS analysis. Community‐weighted altitudinal optima for species in a plot decreased strongly with increasing shade (GLM, Standardized Regression Coefficient SRC = −.41, p = .003), but increased only weakly with altitude (SRC = .26, p = .054). In other words, young stands were dominated by species with higher altitudinal optima than old stands. Forest species richness increased with Log Shade index (SRC = .12, p = .008), but was unaffected by altitude (SRC = −.07, p = .13). However, richness of alpine and heathland species was not highest in plots with lowest Shade index, but displayed a unimodal pattern with an initial increase, followed by a decrease when shading increased (altitude was not significant). Our results indicate that disturbance from the traditional patch burning increases the available habitat for less competitive high‐altitude plants and prevents tree line ascent. Therefore, maintaining, but regulating, the traditional land use increases the Afro‐alpine flora's resilience to global warming. However, this system is threatened by a new REDD+ program attempting to increase carbon storage via fire suppression. This study highlights the importance of understanding traditional management regimes for biodiversity conservation in cultural landscapes in an era of global change.",

      "rioxx2_description": "The construct ‘mathematical resilience’ [1] was developed to describe a positive stance towards learning mathematics, that includes both persistence and perseverance [2], recruiting support when needed. Mathematical resilience can be engineered within both formal and informal learning environments by strategic, explicit focus on the culture of learning mathematics. A focus on ‘mathematical resilience’ enables learners to manage and protect themselves from unhelpful emotions, such as mathematics anxiety, that may arise when mathematics becomes difficult, as well as to recruit appropriate support. Mathematical resilience is not just something that learners do or do not have, it can be grown. \r\nIn a previous paper [3] we described working with Further Education (FE) teachers to engineer the growth of mathematical resilience in their practice. In this paper, we discuss the outcomes of a teacher Work Group focussed on building mathematical resilience (January to July 2018). Following previous work on growth mindsets with teachers local to Birmingham, UK, through their Maths Hub, work done locally with FE teachers [4,5], and the work of Clare Lee [6] with a southern UK Maths Hub, teachers were recruited to join a local Work Group called ‘building mathematical resilience’. The Work Group was advertised as ‘suitable for primary, secondary and FE colleagues at all stages of their professional education’. 16 teacher volunteers were chosen to take part on a first-come-first-served basis.\r\nThe Work Group focused on developing teachers’ awareness of affective barriers to learning mathematics, such as mathematics anxiety and avoidance, and how to develop more resilience in learners working on mathematics. Key concepts included: the hand model of the brain [7] to understand the impact of anxiety on thinking, the growth zone model [8] as a means to help learners understand and articulate their feelings when learning mathematics, and to promote mathematical safe-guarding, and some mindfulness techniques to trigger the relaxation response [9] if a learner begins to experience anxiety. Teaching for resilience also involves teachers developing in learners: a growth mindset; willingness to struggle (persistence); knowledge of how to work at mathematics when stuck and how to recruit support (perseverance); understanding of the meaning, value, personal relevance and purpose of mathematics.\r\nBased on Dylan Wiliam’s components for effective teacher learning communities, in which all teachers embrace the idea of continuous improvement, the local Maths Hub adopts an approach in which teachers collaborate to change their practice with: Choice, Flexibility, Small steps, Accountability and Support. The Work Group was organised as four face-to-face sessions combined with membership of an online community and pre-reading. The four sessions were: an introductory day of input, group learning and action planning; two twilight sessions of feedback, new learning, and personal action planning; a feedback day, sharing evidence of impact, evaluation and reviewing, and of beginning preparation for a joint publication to share the work with other teachers. This structure enabled the session leader to optimise teacher self-efficacy by sharing mastery, vicarious experiences, verbal persuasion, encouragement and positive affect. In the paper, we discuss the outcomes.\r\nKeywords: mathematics anxiety, learned helplessness, mathematical resilience, teacher learning communities, action research",

We aimed to establish whether illness episodes in relation to menstruation, childbirth and menopause are associated with each other in women who have bipolar disorder.\r\n\r\nMethod: Participants were 339 post‐menopausal women with DSM‐IV bipolar disorder recruited into the Bipolar Disorder Research Network (www.bdrn.org). History of premenstrual mood change was measured using the self‐report Premenstrual Symptoms Screening Tool (PSST). History of postpartum episodes was measured via semi‐structured interview (Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry, SCAN) and inspection of case‐notes. Participants self‐reported illness episodes during the perimenopausal period via questionnaire.\r\n\r\nResults: History of a postpartum episode within six months of delivery (OR=2.13, P=0.03) and history of moderate\/severe premenstrual syndrome (OR=6.33, P<0.001) were significant predictors of the presence of a perimenopausal episode, even after controlling for demographic factors. When we narrowed the definition of premenstrual mood change to premenstrual dysphoric disorder it remained significant (OR=2.68, P=0.007). History of postpartum psychosis was a significant predictor of a manic (OR=2.84, P=0.03) but not depressive episode during perimenopause.\r\n\r\nConclusion: Some women who have bipolar disorder may be particularly vulnerable to illness episodes in relation to reproductive cycle events throughout their life.

Until recently, they received little institutional or public support, and faced negative social sanctions for playing the hyper-masculine sport. But the Fijiana, the women’s national team, have made remarkable accomplishments in the last few years, including their qualification, along with only 11 other countries in the world, for the 2016 Summer Olympics. These achievements have significantly increased institutional and public support, although club registration remains low and limited resources (compared to those available to men’s rugby) are allocated to the development of women’s rugby. Given both the historical challenges and the remarkable recent achievements of Fijian women rugby players, this chapter, based on a mixed-method study consisting of a questionnaire survey (n = 70) and focus group discussions (n = 12), explores their motivations for playing rugby and continued involvement in the game against adversities as well as the key obstacles",

In this article we intend to contribute to the growing body of transformative research in the sociology of sport with reflections on our experience as dominant group researchers in a post-colonial, sub-cultural sporting environment; women’s rugby union in Fiji. We first examine the dilemmas and uncertainties engendered by our gendered\/sexual positionalities and how we have sought to negotiate them. We also place our research in the context of Pacific islanders’ continuous effort for knowledge decolonisation and examine the ways in which our research replicates colonial silencing of local voices, however inadvertently. Finally, we explore the broader transformative potentials researchers may contribute to by situating their work as a collective and dialogic project within and beyond academic exercises, between researchers, athletes and others.",

The study used narrative inquiry to explore academics’ accounts. The paper provides a literature review and then presents the findings which indicate that often procedural processes interrupt the process of curriculum making. The paper uses scenarios to illustrate the ways in which procedural processes can result in subverting and subversive practices during the validation process. It is, therefore, argued that academics take up particular stances, defined here as positional identities, which may help or hinder the validation process. The paper argues that by ignoring staff experiences, the risk is that dominant discourses of regulation become accepted without question and the spaces available for dialogue about professional futures, alongside creation of flexible curricula to address these needs, are crowded out by the performative requirements of the process.",

      "rioxx2_description": "For considerable time, academia (in particular, the Humanities) has been in an intellectual, economic and pragmatic par des deux with the culture and arts sector (in this case, heritage, museums and archives). In many ways, given their respective pursuits of scientific enquiry and learning, valuable contribution to a knowledge economy, commitment to public enlightenment, and exploration of critical and creative endeavour, a relationship between the sectors makes sense. Unity notwithstanding, the relationships have become increasingly now influenced by (en)forced contextual constraints (e.g., government policy development and intervention, neoliberal market forces, structural and ideological shifts in funding acquisition and allocation, patronage changes and demands, and\/or individual political priorities) (Dubuc 2011; McCall and Gray 2014; Watson 2002). Drawing on education and heritage scholarship, and theoretical frameworks of sport culture spaces (Hardy, Loy and Booth 2009; Phillips 2012; Pinson 2017), this paper examines efforts undertaken at one specific Higher Education establishment in the United Kingdom in which institutional agendas (vis-à-vis historical and cultural foci, encouraging ‘impactful’ academic activity, brand exposure, economic efficiency, and community engagement) have contoured, and become entwined with, an embryonic sport heritage and archive project. Recalling similar arrangements elsewhere (Krüger 2014; Reilly, Clayton and Hughson 2014; Reilly 2015), the aim of this case study is to explore how the wider education and cultural policy context have precipitated an increasingly symbiotic and dependent relationship between university and cultural\/arts initiatives. The paper considers how the impetus to develop a sports-based (basketball) heritage archive and study centre reflects the current fragilities of the two sectors, yet, concomitantly, reveals the potentials that might be developed from fostering greater intellectual and pragmatic alliances. The paper concludes by advocating the practical, political and ideological usefulness of network formation, sustainability measures and continued cross-sector dialogue.",

      "rioxx2_description": "Background\r\nSeasonal pollen integral (SPIn) – the integral over time of pollen concentration - is considered an important parameter in aerobiological studies. It is mainly used to quantify the severity of pollen seasons as well as in numerical models to simulate pollen emissions and concentrations. According to the recent studies the SPIn interannual variability is modelled using a statistical approach by analysing 10-20 years of pollen and meteorological observations at the specific region. \r\nMethods\r\nThis study is based on a mechanistic approach which describes grass growth by variation of meteorological parameters in the UK: air temperature, precipitation, shortwave radiation, as well as CO2. Our approach suggests that grass growth correlates with the grass SPIn interannual variability. Six pollen observation sites across the UK have been chosen for this study: Worcester, Leicester, Cardiff, Plymouth, Isle of Wight and Invergowrie. The pollen observation data cover a 21-year period (1995-2015). The meteorological data, provided by the UK Met Office, are gridded data with 5 km horizontal resolution over the UK. The mechanistic approach will be tested for the selected sites and then applied to the grid. \r\nResults\r\nAnalysis of the grass SPIn interannual variability showed the highest SPIn variation at Worcester (from 2908 pollen*day\/m3 in 1995 to 10856 pollen*day\/m3 in 2006) and Isle of Wight (from 1423 pollen*day\/m3 in 1999 to 6815 pollen*day\/m3 in 2013) among the considered stations. This could be explained by high variation of local pollen sources at the Worcester site and atmospheric transport from the South to Isle of Wight. \r\nConclusions\r\nThe grass SPIn analysis did not show correlation between the selected stations during the period studied. The new approach also has the practical application that it can be used directly to estimate local grass pollen productivity in the UK for a better estimation of the severity of the grass pollen season.",

The recent studies therefore are devoted to developments of inventories allowing to quantify pollen sources. Pollen source inventories are commonly used for exposure studies, atmospheric transport modelling as well as pollen forecasting. The purpose of this study is to evaluate three pollen source maps using an atmospheric transport model. \r\n\r\nMethods\r\nHere we evaluate three maps for the birch taxon: (1) a map derived by combining of land use data and forest inventory; (2) a map obtained by using land use data and pollen observations; (3) a statistical map resulted from analysis of forest inventory and forest plot data. \r\nThe maps were introduced to the Enviro-HIRLAM (Environment - High Resolution Limited Area Model) as input data to simulate birch pollen concentrations over Europe for the birch pollen season 2006. Six model runs were performed using each of the selected maps in turn with and without calibration with observed pollen data from 2006. The model results were compared with the pollen observation data at 12 measurement sites located in Finland, Denmark and Russia.  \r\n\r\nResults\r\nIt was shown that calibration of the maps using pollen observations significantly improved the model performance for all three maps. The findings also indicate the large sensitivity of the model results to the source maps and agree well with other studies on birch showing that pollen or hybrid based source maps provide the best model performance. \r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nThis study highlights the importance of including pollen data in the production of source maps for pollen dispersion modelling and for exposure studies.",

We address the following research questions: (1) Do women have lower levels of employment within various job functions in the drone industry compared to their male colleagues? (2) Is there a difference in drone industry employment between genders among various countries? Statistical analysis of personnel information found on the websites of 112 drone services firms in seven countries found that women were under-represented in the drone industry. They were also less likely to hold technical or managerial roles such as drone pilots or technical managers among all countries surveyed.

      "rioxx2_description": "Purpose \r\nPhysiotherapists work in increasingly diverse areas of practice across both health and social care sectors. Consequently, education providers are being urged to ensure students graduate with the necessary skills to work flexibly in a range of environments in both traditional and emerging roles (1). Role emerging placements (REPs) – i.e. those conducted in settings where there may be little or no existing therapy provision – are commonly used within occupational therapy (OT) to help prepare students for contemporary practice by providing opportunities to improve their problem-solving skills, leadership and autonomy through development of their own professional role (2). \r\n\r\nThere is, however, little published literature on the use of REPs in Physiotherapy. This poster will consider the practicalities and student experiences of REPs in Physiotherapy (3).\r\n\r\n\r\nMethod\r\nStaff collaborated with OT colleagues to develop REPs with local partners who had identified a need for Physiotherapy. REPs were allocated to a selection of 2nd year and 3rd year students.  Students were supported on a daily basis by an onsite-supervisor, and a qualified clinician provided off-site or ‘long-armed’ supervision to help students draw on their knowledge of theory to develop their own role. \r\n\r\nStudents who had undertaken a REP were invited to take part in a focus group, which used a research informed semi-structured topic guide to explore their experiences (3). Six participants volunteered to take part.  Group discussions were digitally recorded, professionally transcribed verbatim and thematically analysed. Ethical approval was gained from the University of Worcester.  University staff who had been involved in establishing REPs were asked to share their experiences regarding the practicalities of successfully implementing REPs.  \r\n\r\n\r\nResults\r\nStudents completed REPs in a range of settings including; residential and nursing homes, learning disabilities, neurological charities and mental health. REPs require careful planning and preparation and all parties require ongoing support. Thematic analysis of the focus group data revealed five main themes: (1) Establishing a Physiotherapy Role Independently; (2) Finding a Voice and Influencing Change; (3) Developing Professional Identity; (4) Professional Development and (5) Support.  The findings highlighted the variability of student experiences in REP settings, however, all appeared to result in professional and personal benefits for the students, through promoting graduate skills that may be attractive to employers.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nREPs appear to offer a non-traditional developmental learning opportunity where physiotherapy students can develop the skills required to deal with change and adapt to new roles. Students reported both positive and negative experiences, but most students felt the REPs had resulted in a number of professional and personal benefits. Adequate time and resources are required to ensure all parties are prepared and supported.\r\n\r\nImplications\r\nREPs have the potential to both increase placement capacity and equip students with the skills to deal with a changing healthcare environment. However, it is important to publicize both the challenges and benefits associated with this placement model. Successful REPs require careful planning and provision of adequate support mechanisms. Development of good practice CSP guidelines would help to facilitate wider use of REPs and educate the profession on their value.",

      "rioxx2_description": "The Department of Health and Social Care has recently reiterated its commitment to improvement in the quality of end-of-life care and emphasised the importance of all patients having rapid access to medication. The aim of this study was to explore the lived experiences of clinical nurse specialists who are able to prescribe the lived experiences of clinical nurse specialists who are able to prescribe independently in their role in providing support for patients with palliative care needs within the community setting.

This purposive sampling was preferred with semi-structured interviews as the most appropriate data collection technique. Participants interviewed reported that being able to prescribe enabled them to provide seamless, holistic care which facilitated faster access to medicines for their patients. This was particularly apparent at weekends when the patient's usual general practitioner (GP) was unavailable.  Several benefits of nurse independent prescribing were also highlighted.

      "rioxx2_description": "The etiologies of bipolar disorder (BD) and schizophrenia include a large number of common risk alleles, many of which are shared across the disorders. BD is clinically heterogeneous and it has been postulated that the pattern of symptoms is in part determined by the particular risk alleles carried, and in particular, that risk alleles also confer liability to schizophrenia influence psychotic symptoms in those with BD. To investigate links between psychotic symptoms in BD and schizophrenia risk alleles we employed a data-driven approach in a genotyped and deeply phenotyped sample of subjects with BD. We used sparse canonical correlation analysis (sCCA) (Witten, Tibshirani, & Hastie, ) to analyze 30 psychotic symptoms, assessed with the OPerational CRITeria checklist, and 82 independent genome-wide significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified by the Schizophrenia Working group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium for which we had data in our BD sample (3,903 subjects). As a secondary analysis, we applied sCCA to larger groups of SNPs, and also to groups of symptoms defined according to a published factor analyses of schizophrenia. sCCA analysis based on individual psychotic symptoms revealed a significant association (p = .033), with the largest weights attributed to a variant on chromosome 3 (rs11411529), chr3:180594593, build 37) and delusions of influence, bizarre behavior and grandiose delusions. sCCA analysis using the same set of SNPs supported association with the same SNP and the group of symptoms defined \"factor 3\" (p = .012). A significant association was also observed to the \"factor 3\" phenotype group when we included a greater number of SNPs that were less stringently associated with schizophrenia; although other SNPs contributed to the significant multivariate association result, the greatest weight remained assigned to rs11411529. Our results suggest that the canonical correlation is a useful tool to explore phenotype-genotype relationships. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to apply this approach to complex, polygenic psychiatric traits. The sparse canonical correlation approach offers the potential to include a larger number of fine-grained systematic descriptors, and to include genetic markers associated with other disorders that are genetically correlated with BD.",

      "rioxx2_description": "Although the descriptor often carries negative connotations, rationing is, depending on how it is defined, neither ‘good’ nor ‘bad’ in itself. Indeed, if we suppose that rationing describes the controlled or managed allocation of scarce resources, and\/or if it designates means or methods of constructing, restricting and channelling demand then – arguably – absent unlimited resources, it is an ever present and inescapable part of everyday real-world decision making. Rationing can be justified on rational, practical, and ethical grounds. And the question is not then ‘do nurses ration care? Rather, it is, ‘do nurses ration care well?’ \r\nThe IPONS 2018 conference theme speaks about rationing in relation to a dearth of decision making frameworks. No doubt frameworks can be useful, they may help structure and formalise rationing.

      "abstract": "Although the descriptor often carries negative connotations, rationing is, depending on how it is defined, neither ‘good’ nor ‘bad’ in itself. Indeed, if we suppose that rationing describes the controlled or managed allocation of scarce resources, and\/or if it designates means or methods of constructing, restricting and channelling demand then – arguably – absent unlimited resources, it is an ever present and inescapable part of everyday real-world decision making. Rationing can be justified on rational, practical, and ethical grounds. And the question is not then ‘do nurses ration care? Rather, it is, ‘do nurses ration care well?’ \r\nThe IPONS 2018 conference theme speaks about rationing in relation to a dearth of decision making frameworks. No doubt frameworks can be useful, they may help structure and formalise rationing. However, technical solutions (i.e. the use of these sorts of tool) cannot absolve practitioners from making judgements. Determining whether rationing is done well or not thus involves judgement, and judgements are unavoidably contestable. How then should nurses think about the judgements that are involved in rationing decisions? What needs to be considered? \r\nWe might note the political nature of rationing judgements (and political questions are not, I would stress, synonymous with ethical questions). Or, we could step back and think about the nature of nursing in relation to complex problems of the sort thrown out by rationing.

Conservation strategies therefore require a detailed understanding of pollination ecology. This two-year study examined the interactions between the sexually deceptive\r\norchid, Orchis galilaea, and its pollinator Lasioglossum marginatum. Relationships were investigated across three different habitats known to support O. galilaea (garrigue, oak woodland, and mixed oak\/pine woodland) in Lebanon. Visitation rates to flowers were extremely low and restricted to male bees. The reproductive success of O. galilaea under ambient conditions was 29.3% (±2.4), compared to 89.0% (±2.1) in plants receiving cross-pollination by hand. No difference in reproductive success was found between habitat types, but values of reproductive success were positively correlated to the abundance of male bees. Pollination limitation can have negative impacts on the population growth of orchids, and this study provides clear evidence for more holistic approaches to habitat conservation to support specific interactions.",

      "abstract": "Plant species dependent on highly specific interactions with pollinators are vulnerable to environmental change. Conservation strategies therefore require a detailed understanding of pollination ecology. This two-year study examined the interactions between the sexually deceptive\r\norchid, Orchis galilaea, and its pollinator Lasioglossum marginatum. Relationships were investigated across three different habitats known to support O. galilaea (garrigue, oak woodland, and mixed oak\/pine woodland) in Lebanon. Visitation rates to flowers were extremely low and restricted to male bees. The reproductive success of O. galilaea under ambient conditions was 29.3% (±2.4), compared to 89.0% (±2.1) in plants receiving cross-pollination by hand. No difference in reproductive success was found between habitat types, but values of reproductive success were positively correlated to the abundance of male bees. Pollination limitation can have negative impacts on the population growth of orchids, and this study provides clear evidence for more holistic approaches to habitat conservation to support specific interactions.",

The extent to which men’s and women’s treatment needs are similar or different is unclear. The aim of this systematic review was to synthesise what is known about the risk factors for IPV perpetration by women located within criminal justice settings to inform appropriate interventions for this group of offenders. Thirty-one studies met inclusion criteria and no factors meeting our definition of risk factor were identified. However, there were associations between IPV perpetration and experience of child abuse, substance use, borderline personality traits, attachment issues and experiencing trauma. It remains unclear what factors need to be targeted in interventions for female IPV perpetrators, although associations have pointed to possible predisposing factors. In order to improve the evidence base for IPV interventions, researchers need to clearly define the term ‘risk factor’, extending beyond reporting on prevalence only, and to increase understanding of the pathways to IPV perpetration among women.",

In order to improve the evidence base for IPV interventions, researchers need to clearly define the term ‘risk factor’, extending beyond reporting on prevalence only, and to increase understanding of the pathways to IPV perpetration among women.",

Aquatic habitat modelling is used to determine environmental flow strategies by estimating the effects of historic, current or future flow scenarios on habitat availability. The origins of aquatic habitat modelling for determining environmental flows can be traced to the development of the Instream Flow Incremental Methodology (IFIM) and the set of computer programs required to implement an IFIM study, i.e. the Physical Habitat Simulation (PHABSIM) system. More recently, other models have used alternative approaches, such as CASiMiR (Computer Aided Simulation Model for Instream Flow and Riparia) that utilises a mix of expert opinion and fuzzy logic based rules to describe the habitat use of target species or the application of multidimensional, i.e., two-dimensional and to a lesser extent three-dimensional hydraulic-habitat models. These enable an enhanced representation of the hydraulic environment and allow the calculation and modelling of turbulent flow properties. However, a knowledge of how biota respond to and are influenced by these properties remains an ongoing challenge to incorporate them into environmental flow setting.",

This study evaluated the impact of a staff training intervention designed to enhance patient adherence.\r\nThe health psychology informed intervention was predicted to produce sustained improvements in staff knowledge, confidence and intention to use adherence focused strategies with patients.\r\nMethod: A longitudinal mixed method design was used to evaluate the training impact. Thirty one health professionals (general and specialist nurses, GPs, pharmacists) working with anaphylaxis patients in\r\nUK hospitals and general practice attended a 90 minute workshop training staff in psychologically informed strategies to enhance patient adherence. Attendees completed an online survey measuring their knowledge, confidence and intention to use adherence enhancing strategies one week before, and 1-3 and 6–8 weeks after the workshop. Staff were also invited to complete a telephone interview after attending to explore further the workshop impact.\r\nResults: Chi ‐ square goodness of fit tests were significant in most cases (P <.05). The workshop produced sustained (6 – 8 weeks)improvements in staff knowledge, confidence and intention to use strategies enhancing patient adherence. Staff certainty about the\r\nclinical importance of adherence also increased. Thematic analysis of the qualitative interview data identified four themes:\r\n•Altered understanding of anaphylaxis patients' experiences\r\nfrom primarily physical to also psychological\r\n• Changed staff communication with other patient groups\r\n• Contextual barriers impeded use of adherence enhancing\r\nstrategies with patients\r\n• Conflict around 'risks’ when promoting adherence amongst\r\nanaphylaxis patients\r\nConclusions:\r\nAlthough a small study, the workshops had positive\r\nimpacts on attendees’ ability and willingness to address patients’ nonadherence, and understanding of the complex psychological factors associated with patient adherence.

      "rioxx2_description": "Genomic prediction has the potential to contribute to precision medicine. However, to date, the utility of such predictors is limited due to low accuracy for most traits. Here theory and simulation study are used to demonstrate that widespread pleiotropy among phenotypes can be utilised to improve genomic risk prediction. We show how a genetic predictor can be created as a weighted index that combines published genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics across many different traits. We apply this framework to predict risk of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in the Psychiatric Genomics consortium data, finding substantial heterogeneity in prediction accuracy increases across cohorts. For six additional phenotypes in the UK Biobank data, we find increases in prediction accuracy ranging from 0.7 for height to 47 for type 2 diabetes, when using a multi-trait predictor that combines published summary statistics from multiple traits, as compared to a predictor based only on one trait. © 2018 The Author(s).",

      "abstract": "Genomic prediction has the potential to contribute to precision medicine. However, to date, the utility of such predictors is limited due to low accuracy for most traits. Here theory and simulation study are used to demonstrate that widespread pleiotropy among phenotypes can be utilised to improve genomic risk prediction. We show how a genetic predictor can be created as a weighted index that combines published genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics across many different traits. We apply this framework to predict risk of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in the Psychiatric Genomics consortium data, finding substantial heterogeneity in prediction accuracy increases across cohorts. For six additional phenotypes in the UK Biobank data, we find increases in prediction accuracy ranging from 0.7 for height to 47 for type 2 diabetes, when using a multi-trait predictor that combines published summary statistics from multiple traits, as compared to a predictor based only on one trait. © 2018 The Author(s).",

To investigate the relationship between both urinary paramyxovirus (including FeMV) excretion and FeMV seroprevalence and azotemic chronic kidney disease (CKD). Seventy-nine cats (40 for FeMV detection; 72 for seroprevalence). Retrospective cross-sectional, case control study. Viral RNA was extracted from urine for RT-PCR. PCR products were sequenced for virus identification and comparison. The FeMV N protein gene was cloned and partially purified for use as an antigen to screen cat sera for anti-FeMV antibodies by Western Blot. Feline morbillivirus RNA from five distinct morbilliviruses were identified. Detection was not significantly different between azotemic CKD (1\/16) and nonazotemic groups (4\/24; P = .36). Three distinct, non-FeMV paramyxoviruses were present in the nonazotemic group but their absence from the azotemic group was not statistically significant (P = .15). 6\/14 (43%) azotemic cats and 40\/55 (73%) nonazotemic cats were seropositive (P = .06). Feline morbillivirus was detected in cats in the UK for the First time. However, there was no association between virus prevalence or seropositivity and azotemic CKD. These data do not support the hypothesis that FeMV infection is associated with the development of azotemic CKD in cats in the UK. [Abstract copyright: © 2018 The Authors.

      "rioxx2_description": "EMDR therapy is recommended in several guidelines in the International field of psychological trauma. The dual attention stimuli\/alternating bilateral stimulation\r\n(DAS\/ABS) element of EMDR therapy has no proposed mechanism of action agreed upon, which explains the rapid shifts in cognitions and dysfunctional traumatic\r\nmemory networks that are central to its observable efficacy. This paper discusses an innate, biological mechanism found in biological systems, including the human\r\nnervous system that may explain the efficacy of DAS\/ABS. This mechanism is stochastic resonance (SR). SR is observed to make unintelligible, subthreshold signals\r\nintelligible and facilitates signal transmission. It provides a potential mechanism for discrimination and the selective focusing of attention, which are important\r\nfactors in effective psychotherapy for the psychologically traumatised individual. The body\/mind complex aims to achieve the functional encoding of memories in\r\nthe neocortex and a key structural crossroads in this process is the thalamus. Activity in the thalamus is decreased in Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) compared\r\nto non-PTSD patients and a form of ‘gating’ is known to occur at the thalamic level. This ‘gating’ is adaptive and it is postulated to protect the higher neocortical\r\nsystems in times of trauma. Although the model is initially somewhat counterintuitive, Stochastic Resonance; a form of random ‘noise’, can be considered ‘helpful\r\nrandomness’ and when present in the thalamus SR can help filter and control sensitivity to incoming signals; helping to discriminate what is communicated. Naturally\r\noccurring SR is normally present as a result of descending cortico-thalamic activity, but appears attenuated as a result of exposure to trauma. The view of ‘noise’ in the\r\ncurrent era of cell phones and High Definition is generally negative with science going to significant lengths to clean up signals: i.e. removing noise from them. We do\r\nnot want white noise in our music or during our cell phone calls. However, some researchers invite us to consider that not all noise is bad and the downward corticothalamic\r\n‘noise’ is an example of this category of ‘helpful noise’. This paper will discuss the potential role of SR, as the mechanism by which DAS\/ABS generates a\r\nrandom (stochastic) signal, facilitating a return to functional memory processing, where there is a lack of naturally occurring noise from the descending corticothalamic connections because of exposure to trauma. Modelling the mechanism as SR will facilitate further study into EMDR therapy and this will hopefully\r\nencourage perspicacity, where there has previously been derision.",

Research on military families has received reinvigorated attention over the past decades, in light of current war conflicts and concerns about the impacts of military service, transition demands, and visible and nonvisible war injuries, on military and veterans themselves, and their family members, including children.\r\nTheoretical perspectives suggest that the military family life evolves around the “cycle of deployment” and its stages of predeployment, deployment, post-deployment\/reintegration and re-deployment, each bringing different challenges for military family members, including children. Stressors specific to military families include: repeat and often unpredictable parental separation during deployment; additional stress of left-at home parent and family; deployed parent injury and\/or death; and reintegration stress, including war-related trauma of the returning parent.\r\nThe current study will explore the relationships between parental military career, parenting and developmental outcomes, via secondary data analyses on a sub-sample of children from the Millennium Cohort Study, whose parent(s) were members of the armed forces. The results will be discussed in the context of advancing theoretical perspectives of understanding how cultural and structural features of military family life affect children, parenting and family relationships.",

Using the local newspaper, Worcester News, detailed content analysis was conducted for six months (Monday to Saturday for the same week each month). The analysis highlighted that gender biases continue in Worcester News and that this has implications for training journalists. Male journalists tended to write far more articles about Politics (Political articles were written by 89% of male journalists compared with 11% of female journalists). Similarly, male journalists were more likely to write about Crime and Business (73% of these articles were written by male journalists compared with 27% of female journalists). Female journalists also wrote more about Family issues (36% male journalists compared with 64% of female journalists) and Leisure (34% male journalists compared with 66% female journalists). \r\nThese differences reinforce hard news\/soft news gendered perceptions, as well as providing the readership with role models that tend to strengthen gender stereotypes, such as women being discouraged from engaging in politics and the public sphere. The sole authoritative voices used also tended to be male (49% were male compared with 14% that were solely female).  Female sources were often placed alongside a male (this constituted 29% in Worcester News) – and although these figures tended to be better than the findings from Cochrane (2011), it is suggested that such gender disparities are continuing to reinforce hegemonic masculinity as the dominant norm for journalists and the news they produce.",

Whereas the literature suggests a strong role for this concept in student motivation and learning identity formation and in facilitating positive mental health, their work reveals a dearth of research in medical, and particularly in primary care education. We know that embedded contact with primary care learning environments increases the proportion of medical graduates who enter general practice training and it is likely this association is mediated, at least in part, by the opportunity to develop a sense of belonging in the primary care world. By looking closely at belongingness, might we derive practical applications for enhanced primary care teaching? Using the social learning model proposed by Wenger who developed a concept of ‘modes of belonging’ and the connection with learning, this commentary identifies ways in which primary care educators might think about belonging as they develop learning opportunities.",

Despite the universal appeal of physical activity, historic practices have excluded particular groups of people who have assumed lesser forms of human capital. Adapted physical activity (APA) is a field that has responded to some of those segregations with application and relevance to people with impairments. Nevertheless, research in APA is still dominated by post-positivism. There is growing criticism within the field related to the abundance of research ‘on’ and lack of research ‘with’ and ‘by’ people with impairments. Furthermore, research questions in the field are most often pursued from a single axis of analysis and constructed by researchers without impairments. While calls for interdisciplinary approaches to understanding disability are growing, there is also a need to engage intersectionality-informed research methodologies to understanding physical activity and power (im)balances therein. Researchers must recognize and theorize their own and their participants’ complicated intersectional manifestations to demonstrate the structural constraints that exist within the field. This presentation will offer an approach that acknowledges and prioritizes the perspectives and experiences of people with impairments to expand the field of APA. As such, the importance of broadening epistemologies in APA and prioritizing an appreciation for multiple knowledges of people with impairments through intersections of social locations will be considered.",

      "rioxx2_description": "This essay will explore the constitutional significance of the decisions in R (on the application of Bancoult) v Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Office (No. 1) 2001 Q.B. 1067, R (on the application of Bancoult) v Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (No. 2) 2008 UKHL 61, R (on the application of Bancoult) v Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (No. 2) 2016 UKSC 35 and R (on the application of Bancoult) v Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (No. 3) 2014 EWCA Civ 708. The imperfect legacy of the Bancoult litigation deserves a special place within the constitutional jurisprudence of the United Kingdom. At the very core of the decisions in Bancoult (No. 1) and Bancoult (No. 2) was the relationship between the common law and the prerogative, a relationship which, as this essay will argue, ought to have imposed limitations upon the Crown. It will be argued that the decision of the House of Lords in Bancoult (No. 2) demonstrates how a failure of the common law's role to `admeasure' the prerogative amounts to `bad law', especially where, as was in the case of colonial legislation in Bancoult (No. 2), there is arguably ineffective parliamentary oversight. Furthermore, the Bancoult litigation raises issues of the normative purpose of accountability of the prerogative and the competing interests of constitutionalism, national interest and public opinion. In terms as to whether the decision to remove the right of abode could be reviewed by the courts, the national interest of the United Kingdom was an important consideration. The Bancoult litigation highlights the uneasy legacy of colonialism, namely, the treatment of British colonial subjects, the attempts to deny or fetter the rights of these subjects to return home or to engage in economic enterprise, and the limitations on seeking redress before the domestic courts and at the European Court of Human Rights (see Bancoult (No. 2), Bancoult (No. 3) and Chagos Islanders v United Kingdom (Admissibility) (2013) 56 E.H.R.R.

      "rioxx2_description": "3D tissue culture provides a physiologically relevant and genetically tractable system for studying normal and malignant human tissues. Despite this, gene-silencing studies using siRNA has proved difficult. In this study, we have identified a cause for why traditional siRNA transfection techniques are ineffective in eliciting gene silencing in situ within 3D cultures and proposed a simple method for significantly enhancing siRNA entry into spheroids\/organoids. In 2D cell culture, the efficiency of gene silencing is significantly reduced when siRNA complexes are prepared in the presence of serum. Surprisingly, in both 3D tumour spheroids and primary murine organoids, the presence of serum during siRNA preparation rapidly promotes entry and internalization of Cy3-labelled siRNA in under 2 hours. Conversely, siRNA prepared in traditional low-serum transfection media fails to gain matrigel or spheroid\/organoid entry. Direct measurement of CTNNB1 mRNA (encoding β-catenin) from transfected tumour spheroids confirmed a transient but significant knockdown of β-catenin when siRNA:liposome complexes were formed with serum, but not when prepared in the presence of reduced-serum media (Opti-MEM). Our studies suggest a simple modification to standard lipid-based transfection protocols facilitates rapid siRNA entry and transient gene repression, providing a platform for researchers to improve siRNA efficiency in established 3D cultures.",

      "rioxx2_description": "Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the implications of work-life-balance (WLB) challenges for Nigerian female medical doctors. This study focusses on Nigeria, which its peculiar socio-cultural, institutional and professional realities constitute WLB as well as social sustainability (SS) challenge for female medical doctors. Design\/methodology\/approach: Relying on qualitative, interpretivist approach and informed by institutional theory, this study explores how Nigeria's institutional environment and workplace realities engender WLB challenges, which consequently impact SS for female doctors. In total, 43 semi-structured interviews and focus group session involving eight participants were utilised for empirical analysis. Findings: The study reveals that factors such as work pressure, cultural expectations, unsupportive relationships, challenging work environment, gender role challenges, lack of voice\/participation, and high stress level moderate the ability of female medical doctors to manage WLB and SS. It also identifies that socio-cultural and institutional demands on women show that these challenges, while common to female physicians in other countries, are different and more intense in Nigeria because of their unique professional, socio-cultural and institutional frameworks. Research limitations\/implications: The implications of the WLB and SS requires scholarship to deepen as well as extend knowledge on contextual disparities in understanding these concepts from developing countries perspective, which is understudied. Originality\/value: This study offers fresh insights into the WLB and SS concepts from the non-western context, such as Nigeria, highlighting the previously understudied challenges of WLB and SS and their implications for female doctors.

Yet, they have historically developed as two distinct research areas in Europe, with different target species, approaches and management aims, as well as with diverging institutions and researchers involved. We argue that the strengths of these two disciplines can be highly complementary in implementing management strategies and outline how synergies were created in an international, multidisciplinary project to develop efficient and sustainable management of common ragweed, Ambrosia artemisiifolia. Because this species has severe impacts on human health and is also a crop weed in large parts of Europe, common ragweed is one of the economically most important plant invaders in Europe. Our multidisciplinary approach combining expertise from weed science and plant invasion science allowed us (i) to develop a comprehensive plant demographic model to evaluate and compare management tools, such as optimal cutting regimes and biological control for different regions and habitat types, and (ii) to assess benefits and risks of biological control. It further (iii) showed ways to reconcile different stakeholder interests and management objectives (health versus crop yield), and (iv) led to an economic model to assess invader impact across actors and domains, and effectiveness of control measures. (v) It also led to design and implement management strategies in collaboration with the various stakeholder groups affected by noxious weeds, created training opportunities for early stage researchers in the sustainable management of noxious plants, and actively promoted improved decision making regarding the use of exotic biocontrol agents at the national and European level. We critically discuss our achievements and limitations, and list and discuss other potential Old World (Afro-Eurasian) target species that could benefit from applying such an integrative approach, as typical invasive alien plants are increasingly reported from crop fields and native crop weeds are invading adjacent non-crop land, thereby forming new source populations for further spread.",

      "rioxx2_description": "A growing body of research exists demonstrating the link between effective leadership, team culture and coach-athlete relationships. Perhaps the most prominent framework in recent years has been Transformational Leadership (TFL) (Bass & Riggio, 2006) which has been associated with a wide range of psychosocial benefits such as group cohesion, task cohesion, athlete satisfaction, performance effort and intrinsic motivation.  However, no research to date has examined the development of leadership culture and behaviour across multiple contexts such as the parallel performance and talent development settings that exists within this present study.  This Collaborative Action Research (Evans & Light, 2008) investigation applies TFL within the Severn Stars Superleague netball club.  This project examines the extent to which the co-founding Director (Dr Navin) can enhance the TFL behaviours evident within the club through collaborative consultation and culture change.  \r\n     This project features a positively-focused methodological approach founded on Appreciative Inquiry (AI) (Cooperrider & Whitney, 2005).  The overarching premise of AI is the focus on the positive and aspirational elements of the environment under investigation.  \r\n     This ‘Pop-up University’ Discovery session will enhance delegates’ understanding in two key areas through an active involvement in collaboratively creating solutions to challenging scenarios which have been inspired by the data collected within the project. The session will challenge delegates to examine possible solutions for both short term outcomes and longer term gains in this performance sport context.\r\n     First, the delegates will explore how to practically apply the principles of TFL across both the performance and talent development domains within the club.  Working in small groups, delegates will be set several scenarios and challenged to construct some hypothetical solutions which they will subsequently present to other delegates.\r\n     Second, the delegates will explore the application of AI.  This Discovery Session falls at the mid-point of investigation and so spans the first two phases of the AI (Discovery and Dream) and the latter two stages (Design and Destiny).  Delegates will be introduced to the initial themes drawn from the data analysis of the first two phases of the project and will be tasked with constructing their own ‘Design and Destiny’ phases.",

Although the relevance of coaching to doctoral supervisionhas been noted, research into it remains very limited, and thereis a lack of clarity on how it could be implemented and the skills it\r\nwould require. This reflects a broader lack of pedagogical thinking about doctoral supervision in universities and consequent paucity of HRD interventions to support it. This article addresses these gaps\r\nthrough reporting on stage one of an on-going research project which assessed the applicability of an existing model of coaching, to doctoral supervision. Building on Cook’s model, a new Collaborative Action for Doctoral Supervision model of coaching is proposed that identifies for supervisors and students individual and shared responsibilities and skills required for effective supervision. The article argues that a shift in HRD in relation to doctoral supervision will be necessary if the benefits of adopting this coaching model are to be realized.",

      "rioxx2_description": "The first episode of psychosis represents a critical period wherein comprehensive early intervention in psychosis (EIP) may alter the course of illness. However, evidence from randomized controlled trials that have examined the impact of comprehensive EIP care on clinical and functional recovery assessed by independent blinded raters is limited. The objective of this study was to conduct a single-blinded multicenter trial comparing comprehensive EIP care and standard care in young patients with first-episode psychosis (FEP) in Japan (J-CAP Study). A total of 77 participants with FEP (aged 15–35 years) were randomized to receive standard care or specialized comprehensive EIP care and were followed up for 1.5 years (trial no.: UMIN000005092). Function (measured with the Global Assessment of Functioning) and clinical remission (defined by internationally standardized criteria proposed by the Remission in Schizophrenia Working Group) were evaluated by independent raters who were blinded to group assignment. Dropout rate and other secondary outcomes were also examined. The specialized EIP care group had a higher clinical remission rate (odds ratio, 6.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.0–37.9) and lower treatment dropout rate (odds ratio, 0.038; 95% confidence interval, 0.002–0.923) than the standard care group, even after adjusting for baseline characteristics. Functional improvement in the specialized EIP care group was slightly higher than that in the standard care group, but this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.195). From the results, we conclude that comprehensive EIP care may provide advantages over standard care in patients with FEP.",

      "abstract": "The first episode of psychosis represents a critical period wherein comprehensive early intervention in psychosis (EIP) may alter the course of illness. However, evidence from randomized controlled trials that have examined the impact of comprehensive EIP care on clinical and functional recovery assessed by independent blinded raters is limited. The objective of this study was to conduct a single-blinded multicenter trial comparing comprehensive EIP care and standard care in young patients with first-episode psychosis (FEP) in Japan (J-CAP Study). A total of 77 participants with FEP (aged 15–35 years) were randomized to receive standard care or specialized comprehensive EIP care and were followed up for 1.5 years (trial no.: UMIN000005092). Function (measured with the Global Assessment of Functioning) and clinical remission (defined by internationally standardized criteria proposed by the Remission in Schizophrenia Working Group) were evaluated by independent raters who were blinded to group assignment. Dropout rate and other secondary outcomes were also examined. The specialized EIP care group had a higher clinical remission rate (odds ratio, 6.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.0–37.9) and lower treatment dropout rate (odds ratio, 0.038; 95% confidence interval, 0.002–0.923) than the standard care group, even after adjusting for baseline characteristics. Functional improvement in the specialized EIP care group was slightly higher than that in the standard care group, but this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.195). From the results, we conclude that comprehensive EIP care may provide advantages over standard care in patients with FEP.",

The survey instrument comprised forced-choice questions in four sections: Demographics, ‘Perceptions and understanding of early childhood development’,  ‘Parental behaviours to support early brain development ‘ and ‘Resource needs and usage’.\r\nSetting:  two school sixth forms and one sixth form college in three towns of varying affluence in the West Midlands of the UK.\r\nMethod: the survey was mounted online and completed by 905 students who returned it directly to the researcher.\r\nResults:  Most students knew that tobacco, alcohol and drugs are hazardous in pregnancy, and many recognised the impact of maternal stress on foetal brain development. Many believed that babies can be ‘spoiled’ and did not appreciate the importance of reading to babies and of the relationship between play and early brain development. A significant minority thought that physical activity and a healthy diet have little impact on young children’s development. Respondents said they would turn firstly to their parents for advice on babycare rather than professionals.\r\nConclusion: Young people need educating about parenting activities that support the all-round healthy development of infants. The importance of a healthy diet, physical activity, reading and play should be included in sixth-form curricula and antenatal classes. Consideration should be given to educating grandparents because of their influence on new parents.",

      "rioxx2_description": "Purpose\r\nEntrepreneurship education plays a crucial role in the development of entrepreneurs and the enhancement of entrepreneurial activities in every economy. This article presents the findings of a review of Nigerian entrepreneurship education literature published in 20 journals over a 16-year period. The purpose of the study was to examine research contributions in the field of entrepreneurship education within the Nigerian context, with the aim of understanding the focus and the different research areas covered by researchers in this area, and to make suggestions that can guide scholars in their future research contributions.\r\n\r\nDesign\/methodology\/approach \r\nSystematic literature reviews are recognized methods for conducting evidence based research. The study adopted a systematic literature review approach, drawing from a computerized search of five selected data bases, using predetermined key words by the researchers. \r\n\r\nFindings \r\nThe main finding of this paper is that related concepts like skills, intention, drive and attitude have been used in expounding discussions on the outcome of entrepreneurship education, but very little has been written on entrepreneurial mindset, which other studies have suggested is a crucial point in the journey of an entrepreneur (Reed and Stoltz, 2011; Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education (QAA), 2012; Neneh, 2012). Furthermore, learning and teaching of entrepreneurship in the Nigerian higher education institutions seem to be more focused on creating awareness about entrepreneurship, as against the experiential approach that scholars have argued to be a prerequisite for developing the next generation of entrepreneurs (Bell, 2015). The study also found that over 80% of the reviewed articles are published in journals not ranked or indexed in the ABS journal rankings or the Scopus database.\r\n\r\nResearch limitations\/implications \r\nThe paper is limited since it is based on a review of literature from a selected range of databases, covering a specific time span. This potentially excludes other studies outside this time span. Scholarship in this area and context will benefit greatly when researchers target, choose and engage the higher ranked and more impactful journals as the outlet for their research outputs.\r\n\r\nPractical Implication \r\nAt a time when efforts are being made to address socioeconomic issues like poverty and unemployment through mainstream training in entrepreneurship education, this paper provides a better understanding of the state of research in this context, by highlighting the potential gaps as to where research investigation is needed for better policy formulation and guiding future research. \r\n\r\nOriginality\/value \r\nThere are limited studies that focus on the issue of entrepreneurial mindset in entrepreneurship education in Nigeria. Overall, this paper identifies an important gap in the literature that warrants future research.",

      "abstract": "Purpose\r\nEntrepreneurship education plays a crucial role in the development of entrepreneurs and the enhancement of entrepreneurial activities in every economy. This article presents the findings of a review of Nigerian entrepreneurship education literature published in 20 journals over a 16-year period. The purpose of the study was to examine research contributions in the field of entrepreneurship education within the Nigerian context, with the aim of understanding the focus and the different research areas covered by researchers in this area, and to make suggestions that can guide scholars in their future research contributions.\r\n\r\nDesign\/methodology\/approach \r\nSystematic literature reviews are recognized methods for conducting evidence based research. The study adopted a systematic literature review approach, drawing from a computerized search of five selected data bases, using predetermined key words by the researchers. \r\n\r\nFindings \r\nThe main finding of this paper is that related concepts like skills, intention, drive and attitude have been used in expounding discussions on the outcome of entrepreneurship education, but very little has been written on entrepreneurial mindset, which other studies have suggested is a crucial point in the journey of an entrepreneur (Reed and Stoltz, 2011; Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education (QAA), 2012; Neneh, 2012). Furthermore, learning and teaching of entrepreneurship in the Nigerian higher education institutions seem to be more focused on creating awareness about entrepreneurship, as against the experiential approach that scholars have argued to be a prerequisite for developing the next generation of entrepreneurs (Bell, 2015). The study also found that over 80% of the reviewed articles are published in journals not ranked or indexed in the ABS journal rankings or the Scopus database.\r\n\r\nResearch limitations\/implications \r\nThe paper is limited since it is based on a review of literature from a selected range of databases, covering a specific time span. This potentially excludes other studies outside this time span. Scholarship in this area and context will benefit greatly when researchers target, choose and engage the higher ranked and more impactful journals as the outlet for their research outputs.\r\n\r\nPractical Implication \r\nAt a time when efforts are being made to address socioeconomic issues like poverty and unemployment through mainstream training in entrepreneurship education, this paper provides a better understanding of the state of research in this context, by highlighting the potential gaps as to where research investigation is needed for better policy formulation and guiding future research. \r\n\r\nOriginality\/value \r\nThere are limited studies that focus on the issue of entrepreneurial mindset in entrepreneurship education in Nigeria. Overall, this paper identifies an important gap in the literature that warrants future research.",

Not mildly distorted, in need of the odd correction here and there, but systematically misrepresented. One problem is that van Manen appears to have an idée fixe which prevents him from recognizing that the book is not about a certain philosophical tradition (known as “phenomenology”), but about a particular type of qualitative research (also known, unfortunately and confusingly, as “phenomenology”). A second idée fixe disposes him to misread an earlier article of mine and (much more seriously) three works by Heidegger. My aim in this article is to describe these two idées fixes, and exhibit their consequences. In doing so, I will examine what van Manen has to say on four crucial topics: meaning, lived experience, empathy, and Heidegger's analysis of boredom in The Fundamental Concepts of Metaphysics.",

      "rioxx2_description": "Amedeo Giorgi has published a review article devoted to Phenomenology as Qualitative Research: A Critical Analysis of Meaning Attribution. However, anyone reading this arti-cle, but unfamiliar with the book, will get a distorted view of what it is about, whom it is addressed to, what it seeks to achieve and how it goes about presenting its argu-ments. Not mildly distorted, in need of the odd correction here and there, but sys-tematically misrepresented. The article is a study in misreading. Giorgi misreads the book’s mise en scène; he misreads its narrative arc; he misreads individual arguments; he misreads short, simple passages; he misreads the philosophy of the science litera-ture; he misreads his own data; he misreads the title; he misreads the blurb; he mis-reads the acknowledgements. In addition, there are serious failures of scholarship (ironically, he demonstrates how unacquainted he is with the relevant literature at the very moment he is accusing me of being ill- informed). In this reply, I provide sev-eral examples of these errors, but my primary aim is to understand why Giorgi’s mis-reading is as ubiquitous as it is. To this end, I explain his mistakes by reference to the hermetic epistemology within which he is confined.",

      "rioxx2_description": "Questions concerning the historic parental right to withdraw children from Collective Worship and Religious Education in schools in England (also known as the ‘conscience clause’) are perennial, foregrounded of late in discussions about the future shape of religious education and its nature and purpose in the English school system. Such discussions, for instance, are reflected by A New Settlement: Religion and Belief in Schools (Clark and Woodhead, 2015, pp26-27) and in Religious Education for All: the interim report of the Commission on Religious Education (pp.78-78). The arguments for the clause’s abolition seem apposite in relation to curriculum RE especially; it goes thus. Firstly, now that curriculum RE’s educational (as opposed to confessional) purpose in state-funded schools without a religious character is clear, then it is no longer necessary to give parents the right to withdraw from the subject. In effect, parents should no longer have troubled consciences when it comes to RE, because the subject’s purpose is to debate rather than to persuade, to educate not indoctrinate. Secondly, given the value, even necessity, of RE as part of a broad and balanced curriculum which prepares young people for life in a diverse society, it seems counterintuitive to provide an exemption from it. Though the logic appears sound, the matter of exemption remains a question for continued consideration and debate. It might be useful at this point to examine the history of the ‘conscience clause’ in England, as well as asking some further questions about whose conscience might still need to be protected when it comes to religious education.",

      "rioxx2_description": "Background: Intrathecal drug delivery is known to reduce pain in patients where conventional systemic analgesia has been ineffective\r\nor intolerable. However, there is little information regarding the effects of intrathecal drug delivery on quality of life and function in\r\nthose with advanced, incurable cancer.\r\nAim: Retrospective exploration of the views of bereaved carers regarding the physical and psychosocial effects of external tunnelled\r\nintrathecal drug delivery in patients with advanced incurable cancer.\r\nDesign: Thematic analysis of qualitative interviews with carers of deceased individuals who received percutaneous external tunnelled\r\nintrathecal drug delivery as part of their pain management, within two UK centres.\r\nSetting: A total of 11 carers were recruited from two UK Palliative Care centres. Family carers of adult patients who had received\r\nexternal tunnelled intrathecal drug delivery analgesia for cancer pain and had died between 6 and 48 months prior to contact were\r\nincluded. Carer relatives who were considered likely to be too vulnerable or who had lodged a complaint about treatment within the\r\nrecruiting department or who had been treated directly by the interviewer were excluded.\r\nResults: In total, 11 interviews took place. The emerging themes were (1) making the decision to have the intrathecal – relatives\r\ndescribed desperate situations with severe pain and\/or sedation, meaning that the individual would try anything; (2) timing and\r\nknowing they were having the best – an increased access to pain and palliative care services, meant carers felt everything possible\r\nwas being done, making the situation more bearable; (3) was it worth it? – the success of the external tunnelled intrathecal drug\r\ndelivery was judged on its ability to enable the individual to be themselves through their final illness. Side effects were often considered\r\nacceptable, if the external tunnelled intrathecal drug delivery enabled improvements in quality of life.\r\nConclusion: Carers perceived external tunnelled intrathecal drug delivery as most valuable when it improved quality of life towards\r\nthe end of life, by reducing pain and side effects of conventional systemic analgesia to enable individuals ‘to be themselves’. Under these\r\ncircumstances, the carers judged significant side effects to be acceptable.Nishi Patel1, Melanie Huddart2, Helen Makins1, Theresa Mitchell3,\r\nJane L Gibbins2, Juan Graterol4, Deborah Stevens2\r\nand Paul Perkins5",

      "abstract": "Background: Intrathecal drug delivery is known to reduce pain in patients where conventional systemic analgesia has been ineffective\r\nor intolerable. However, there is little information regarding the effects of intrathecal drug delivery on quality of life and function in\r\nthose with advanced, incurable cancer.\r\nAim: Retrospective exploration of the views of bereaved carers regarding the physical and psychosocial effects of external tunnelled\r\nintrathecal drug delivery in patients with advanced incurable cancer.\r\nDesign: Thematic analysis of qualitative interviews with carers of deceased individuals who received percutaneous external tunnelled\r\nintrathecal drug delivery as part of their pain management, within two UK centres.\r\nSetting: A total of 11 carers were recruited from two UK Palliative Care centres. Family carers of adult patients who had received\r\nexternal tunnelled intrathecal drug delivery analgesia for cancer pain and had died between 6 and 48 months prior to contact were\r\nincluded. Carer relatives who were considered likely to be too vulnerable or who had lodged a complaint about treatment within the\r\nrecruiting department or who had been treated directly by the interviewer were excluded.\r\nResults: In total, 11 interviews took place. The emerging themes were (1) making the decision to have the intrathecal – relatives\r\ndescribed desperate situations with severe pain and\/or sedation, meaning that the individual would try anything; (2) timing and\r\nknowing they were having the best – an increased access to pain and palliative care services, meant carers felt everything possible\r\nwas being done, making the situation more bearable; (3) was it worth it? – the success of the external tunnelled intrathecal drug\r\ndelivery was judged on its ability to enable the individual to be themselves through their final illness. Side effects were often considered\r\nacceptable, if the external tunnelled intrathecal drug delivery enabled improvements in quality of life.\r\nConclusion: Carers perceived external tunnelled intrathecal drug delivery as most valuable when it improved quality of life towards\r\nthe end of life, by reducing pain and side effects of conventional systemic analgesia to enable individuals ‘to be themselves’. Under these\r\ncircumstances, the carers judged significant side effects to be acceptable.Nishi Patel1, Melanie Huddart2, Helen Makins1, Theresa Mitchell3,\r\nJane L Gibbins2, Juan Graterol4, Deborah Stevens2\r\nand Paul Perkins5",

Following a false accusation of theft, participants were interviewed in one of four questioning conditions (minimisation, repetitive questioning, leading questions, and nonleading questions) in which interviewers adopted a stern or friendly manner. Perceptions of pressure to confess and interviewer behaviours were measured. Significantly more false confessions were elicited using nonleading questions rather than repetitive questioning. More false confessions were elicited in the friendly interviewer condition than in the stern interviewer condition. Neither interviewer manner nor questioning technique had a significant effect on subjective ratings of pressure to confess. The finding that false confessions may be elicited in the absence of coercive tactics may have implications for informing best practices in investigative interviewing.

      "rioxx2_description": "Purpose\r\nMany family businesses do not survive into the second generation. A common reason put forward for this is poor succession planning for the second generation. This paper is designed to explore the role of the father in supporting the son’s business knowledge and development in Vietnamese family businesses.\r\n\r\nDesign\/methodology\/approach \r\nThis research adopted an inductive qualitative approach using multiple face-to-face semi-structured interviews with five father-son succession pairs. The interview participants were a cross section of Vietnamese family businesses, where the father-son pair was involved in the process of business knowledge transfer and the succession process was at an advanced stage. \r\n\r\nFindings\r\nThe results suggest that the father plays different roles at different stages of the son’s business knowledge development process. In particular, the father acts as an example during the son’s childhood; a supporter to encourage the son to gain more business knowledge from both formal education and working experience outside the family business; a mentor and trouble-shooter after the son joins the family business as a full-time employee; and as an advisor after the son becomes the leader of the firm. \r\n\r\n\r\nOriginality\/value \r\nMost Vietnamese family businesses are still operating under the control of the first generation and as a result, research into the succession process in Vietnam can help to provide valuable insights. Furthermore, existing research into the role of the predecessor in the whole process from the successor’s childhood until the end of the succession process is ambiguous and requires further research to clarify this research gap.",

      "abstract": "Purpose\r\nMany family businesses do not survive into the second generation. A common reason put forward for this is poor succession planning for the second generation. This paper is designed to explore the role of the father in supporting the son’s business knowledge and development in Vietnamese family businesses.\r\n\r\nDesign\/methodology\/approach \r\nThis research adopted an inductive qualitative approach using multiple face-to-face semi-structured interviews with five father-son succession pairs. The interview participants were a cross section of Vietnamese family businesses, where the father-son pair was involved in the process of business knowledge transfer and the succession process was at an advanced stage. \r\n\r\nFindings\r\nThe results suggest that the father plays different roles at different stages of the son’s business knowledge development process. In particular, the father acts as an example during the son’s childhood; a supporter to encourage the son to gain more business knowledge from both formal education and working experience outside the family business; a mentor and trouble-shooter after the son joins the family business as a full-time employee; and as an advisor after the son becomes the leader of the firm. \r\n\r\n\r\nOriginality\/value \r\nMost Vietnamese family businesses are still operating under the control of the first generation and as a result, research into the succession process in Vietnam can help to provide valuable insights. Furthermore, existing research into the role of the predecessor in the whole process from the successor’s childhood until the end of the succession process is ambiguous and requires further research to clarify this research gap.",

This study adopted an interpretivist paradigm utilising a social constructionist epistemology in that there are multiple realities to be understood and different perspectives and perceptions to be explored. This interpretivist study explored the impact of social work within an integrated organisation from the perceptions of the practitioners: social workers, occupational therapists and nurses.\r\n\r\nFree-text data from 41 survey respondents were subject to thematic analysis. Subsequently a further 6 interview respondents were also subject to thematic analysis. Data were coded using a multistage approach: coding of comments into general categories (e.g. resources, budgets); coding of subcategories within main categories (e.g. s75 agreement, staffing levels); cross- sectional analysis to identify themes cutting across categories; and mapping of categories\/subcategories to corresponding comparable research for comparison.\r\n\r\nMost free-text respondents (51 per cent) were from social workers, with 32 per cent from occupational therapists and 17 per cent from nurses. 5 interviewees were social workers (83%) with 1 nurse participant (17%). These respondents provided comments that the author developed into four overarching themes: first, culture – cultural biases and clashes of professional culture within an integrated care organisation which result in a negative experience for professionals and confusion for service users and\/or carers. A lack of shared socialisation and the development of a shared culture. Second, austerity: the impact of economic austerity. Third, organisation: conceptual confusion in respect of outlining\/organising\/ structuring integrated care within a health organisation. Fourth, political: the political drivers of integration.\r\n\r\nThis study highlights areas of concern specifically for social workers as well as for integrated social care and health, uncovering a number of themes that exist across the integration journey. While most of the comments were negative, analysis reveals concerns shared by substantial numbers of respondents: conceptual confusion in respect of organising integrated care within a health organisation, a lack of shared socialisation and the development of a shared culture within the integrated organisation, and the impact of economic austerity on integrated care. The findings and recommendations are therefore pertinent to many health and social care organisations looking to integrate in the future.",

Despite having had currency in the library world for many years, with underpinning frameworks that articulate our contribution to our universities, talking the language of information literacy often does not result in the library’s contribution being recognised or valued. \r\n \r\nAt the University of Worcester, we were keen to increase the visibility and impact of our teaching, and decided on a practical, new tool – a “menu” of teaching – that would help academic colleagues understand how we could support their curricula.\r\n\r\nIt quickly became apparent that such a tool needed to be underpinned by academic understanding of students’ skills and development, in a much broader sense than just information literacy.  Thus the learner journey project was born.\r\n\r\nAcademic Liaison Librarians were tasked with conducting informal interviews with staff, often over a coffee, asking such questions as:\r\n-\tWhat assumptions do course teams make about the skills students have at the start of their course?  \r\n-\tWhat expectations do they have about how these skills should develop throughout the degree programme?\r\n-\tHow are these expectations articulated to students?\r\n\r\nConsciously avoiding the term ‘information literacy’, librarians questioned academic staff about the broad skill base that students bring with them and develop at university, mapping their view of the student learner journey from pre-entry through to graduation.  \r\n\r\nAlthough starting out as a small-scale project, it soon piqued the interest of senior management at the university, and grew into a much larger piece of work.  Through focusing on broader skills’ development, we have developed a body of evidence and data that has wide interest and application for both academic Institutes and other professional services (e.g. Disability & Dyslexia).  Alongside highlighting themes, the data has demonstrated inconsistencies across the university and even within departments, with disparate staff attitudes towards such topics as progression, student confidence, and learner independence.  These results have been shared widely across the university, for course teams to discuss, all of which has served to raise Library Services’ teaching and pedagogic profile.\r\nThis session will:\r\n-\tShare data from the project, and overarching themes, as well as some of the internal inconsistencies revealed.  These are surely not unique to Worcester and delegates may find this useful evidence to inform conversation in their institutions.\r\n-\tShowcase our refreshed teaching offer and supporting action plan, encouraging delegates to think about how teaching is promoted and organised in their institutions\r\n-\tEncourage delegates to consider the issue of terminology, and whether taking a different linguistic\/semantic approach can further the cause of information literacy in their institutions\r\n-\tDemonstrate the additional benefits of undertaking this kind of work, from empowering library staff, to tapping into institutional narratives, inspiring delegates to undertake their own research projects or consider new ways to interact with faculty and senior management.",

These are surely not unique to Worcester and delegates may find this useful evidence to inform conversation in their institutions.\r\n-\tShowcase our refreshed teaching offer and supporting action plan, encouraging delegates to think about how teaching is promoted and organised in their institutions\r\n-\tEncourage delegates to consider the issue of terminology, and whether taking a different linguistic\/semantic approach can further the cause of information literacy in their institutions\r\n-\tDemonstrate the additional benefits of undertaking this kind of work, from empowering library staff, to tapping into institutional narratives, inspiring delegates to undertake their own research projects or consider new ways to interact with faculty and senior management.",

      "rioxx2_description": "Developing students’ academic skills is central to the higher education experience, but what assumptions do course teams make about the skills students have at the start of their course?  What expectations do they have about how these skills should develop throughout the degree programme, and how are these articulated to students?\r\nThese were just some of the questions we posed to academic staff at the University of Worcester as part of a pedagogic research project to refresh our teaching offer.  Our initial aim had been to develop a menu of options that helped staff understand what we could deliver and how it might fit into their curricula.  It quickly became apparent that such a tool needed to be underpinned by academic understanding of students’ skills and development, in a much broader sense than ‘just’ information literacy.  Thus the learner journey project was born.\r\nAcademic Liaison Librarians were tasked with conducting informal interviews with staff, often over a coffee, with a few prompt questions to ask where needed.  Consciously avoiding the term ‘information literacy’, they questioned staff about the broad skill base that students bring with them and develop at university, mapping their view of the student learner journey from pre-entry to graduation.  \r\nAlthough starting out as a small-scale project, it soon piqued the interest of senior management at the university, and grew into a much larger piece of work.  Through focusing on broader skills’ development, we have developed a body of evidence and data that has wide interest and application for both academic Institutes and other professional services (e.g. Disability & Dyslexia).  Alongside highlighting themes, the data has demonstrated inconsistencies across the university and even within departments, with disparate staff attitudes towards such topics as progression, student confidence, and learner independence.  These results have been shared widely across the university, for course teams to discuss, all of which has served to raise Library Services’ teaching and pedagogic profile.",

      "rioxx2_description": "Introduction\r\n\r\nViolence in healthcare settings is a concern for healthcare professionals and patients. Media reports, and debate within the healthcare profession, and the academic literature infer that workplaces such as intensive care units are becoming exposed to increasing violence. Increases in the incidence of violent behaviour are sometimes attributed to the increased pressure on emergency departments to accelerate the throughput of patients to meet targets. To ensure the wellbeing of patients and staff, there is a need to evaluate the impact of such targets. The aim in this study was to evaluate the incidence and to describe the context in which patients' aggressive and violent behaviours occurred since the introduction of the National Emergency Access Target in a local tertiary Australian intensive care unit.\r\n\r\n\r\nMethods\r\n\r\nA retrospective examination of events triggering violence-related emergency codes from 12 months before the introduction of the National Emergency Access Target up until 12 months after its implementation (2011–2013).\r\n\r\n\r\nResults\r\n\r\nA small increase in the number of Code Grey\/Code Black activation was identified after the introduction of the target (before = 18, after = 29). Admissions following drug overdoses, isolated head trauma, and cardiac arrest were the presentations most likely to have been associated with a violence-related emergency call. Female registered nurses, male critical care registered nurses, and clinical nurse specialists were the most at risk of occupational violence. Male nursing staff members were found to be more likely to be involved in incidences of verbal violence (p < 0.003).\r\n\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nAlthough there was a minimal increase in the overall number of emergencies triggered by violent behaviour, valuable information on the type of occupational violence occurring towards healthcare professionals and patients in this setting was found. We suggest that these findings add further important detail to the existing understanding of the problem of occupational violence.

      "rioxx2_description": "The London 2012 Olympics and Paralympics have been celebrated in the media and popular discourse to have been unified around the promotion and delivery of the able-bodied and disability framed sporting events. To date there has been limited evidence and literature substantively considering the term legacy in the context of London 2012, specifically, from the perspective of a disability community. This paper intends to explore the positionality of the researcher and the findings from a doctoral project that has evaluated the policy and legacy from the ‘inspire a generation’ aim at the London 2012 Games. In terms of positionality, the researcher will articulate the rupturing of their own able-bodied centric perspective in conducting a document analysis and semi-structured interviews, in particular, the emergence of a disability discourse in the findings. \r\n \r\nIn terms of findings a disability discourse became prevalent in the two phases of data collection. Firstly, through the documents analysis. Where post London 2012 the documents demonstrate a pattern of change in language around inclusivity and disability. Secondly, through the semi-structured interviews. Where a disability discourse has emerged around the supposed tangible legacy of the ‘inspire a generation’ aim, especially, the perception change and delivery of sport in a disability education setting. This paper will present emerging themes and findings that indicate a tension between: legacy literature, empirical evidence and the discourse around disability and the Paralympics more widely. Implications of this research are twofold. Firstly, methodological in terms of the positionality of the researcher; and secondly, empirical in regards to moving our understanding of London 2012 and the legacy aim ‘inspire a generation’ to include and be challenged by the disability community.",

      "rioxx2_description": "This paper presents data from a quasi-experimental trial with paired randomisation that emerged during the development of a reading scheme for children in England. This trial was conducted with a group of 12 children, aged 5–6, and considered to be falling behind their peers in reading ability and a matched control group. There were two intervention conditions (A: using mixed teaching methods and a high percentage of non-phonically decodable vocabulary; P: using mixed teaching methods and low percentage of non-decodable vocabulary); allocation to these was randomised. Children were assessed at pre- and post-test on standardised measures of receptive vocabulary, phoneme awareness, word reading, and comprehension. Two class teachers in the same school each selected 6 children, who they considered to be poor readers, to participate (n = 12). A control group (using synthetic phonics only and phonically decodable vocabulary) was selected from the same 2 classes based on pre-test scores for word reading (n = 16). Results from the study show positive benefits for poor readers from using both additional teaching methods (such as analytic phonics, sight word vocabulary, and oral vocabulary extension) in addition to synthetic phonics, and also non-decodable vocabulary in instructional reading text.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents data from a quasi-experimental trial with paired randomisation that emerged during the development of a reading scheme for children in England. This trial was conducted with a group of 12 children, aged 5–6, and considered to be falling behind their peers in reading ability and a matched control group. There were two intervention conditions (A: using mixed teaching methods and a high percentage of non-phonically decodable vocabulary; P: using mixed teaching methods and low percentage of non-decodable vocabulary); allocation to these was randomised. Children were assessed at pre- and post-test on standardised measures of receptive vocabulary, phoneme awareness, word reading, and comprehension. Two class teachers in the same school each selected 6 children, who they considered to be poor readers, to participate (n = 12). A control group (using synthetic phonics only and phonically decodable vocabulary) was selected from the same 2 classes based on pre-test scores for word reading (n = 16). Results from the study show positive benefits for poor readers from using both additional teaching methods (such as analytic phonics, sight word vocabulary, and oral vocabulary extension) in addition to synthetic phonics, and also non-decodable vocabulary in instructional reading text.",

Observed pacing behaviors are thought to result from complex decision-making processes, and several models have been proposed that may explain the manner in which these decisions are made. In this article we argue that examination of individual factors implicated in the regulation of pacing is unlikely to allow full understanding of the events leading to pacing and performance. Rather than utilizing such a reductionist approach, it is suggested that athletic races be viewed as complex systems, and that pacing behavior is an emergent phenomenon that cannot be fully understood through study of components of the system in isolation. We describe and discuss known and potential interactions between determinants of pacing during races, and conclude with a call for the development of novel research methodologies that may further understanding of the manner in which observed behaviors emerge.",

In 2012, the British Heart Foundation (BHF) launched their PocketCPR training application to simplify bystander CPR training and overcome barriers to resuscitation. This study investigates whether the BHF PocketCPR training application improves the confidence of bystanders who perform CPR during simulated resuscitation attempts.  \r\n\r\nMethods: This is a mixed method study using a randomised crossover trial with questionnaire analysis. 120 participants were randomised to either perform 2 minutes of CPR on a resuscitation manikin using the BHF PocketCPR application or perform CPR without instruction. Participants completed a questionnaire to capture their confidence before completing the opposite arm of the study. Each participant then completed a second questionnaire to allow for comparison of levels of confidence. \r\n\r\nResults: Participants in this study were more confident in their overall performance of CPR using the BHF PocketCPR training application compared to performing CPR without instruction (mean confidence score (0-100): 50.41 with PocketCPR and 43.92 without (p=0.026)). They were also more confident that the number of chest compressions in this study was correct (mean: 60.39 with PocketCPR Vs 46.10 without ((p<0.001)), and in the delivery of CPR without having recent CPR training (mean: 48.67 with BHF PocketCPR vs 39.79 without, (p<0.002)). \r\n\r\nConclusion: The BHF PocketCPR training application improved the confidence of bystanders performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation during simulated resuscitation attempts.",

We combined data from eight focus groups conducted in four schools in England (2 primary\/elementary and 2 secondary\/high; N = 60) and individual interviews conducted in one school in the US (N = 19). Three common themes were identified from our cross-national data: the trustworthiness of candidates, equality, and the narrative surrounding immigration. We argue that it is important for students to have spaces to understand, explore and debate political messages and for teachers to feel confident and able to engage with those campaign messages especially where they may be controversial, partisan or challenging.

Observations of teaching, have in the past, confirmed successful probationary periods, assisted with professional development and provided evidence for performance management and recognition and reward applications. As Thompson, Bell and Hendry (2015) suggest, peer observations are generally undertaken for developmental purposes, whereas observation for performance evaluation has very different intentions.  They go on to state that alongside these different intentions, the subjective nature of observation has led to an increased focus on the effectiveness of the documentation utilised.\r\nAmid the plethora of reasons for undertaking teaching observations, is it possible to develop a universal tool that can capture and verify the quality of teaching, whilst also providing evidence as part of increased external accountability?  The teaching observation template developed in an attempt to meet these differing demands, takes into account the United Kingdom Professional Standards Framework (UKPSF) (Higher Education Academy (HEA), 2011) having been mapped against the institutions’ own teaching domains.

      "rioxx2_description": "Pollen monitoring networks around the world are mainly based on rooftop-located stations on buildings. Thus, measured airborne pollen levels could be different from ground level, where most allergic individual reside. Until now, the effects of height of sampling on pollen concentration are not well documented. The aim of this meta-analysis was to analyse these effects using a large number of twin sampling stations.\r\nPollen data from 45 twin-stations Hirst-type volumetric spore traps were analyzed, with a maximum distance of 5km between the twin traps, from 25 different locations. To compare the effect of height, the mean of the daily ratio of the amounts of pollen registrered at different heights was used. The values of the lowest station were divided by the higher station. Stations between 1.5m and 50 agl were considered.\r\nThe results showed that the traps at lower height registered generally higher pollen concentration (average pollen ratio higher than 1), although the behaviour of the ratio differed per pollen type. For instance, both Poaceae and Betula showed that as the height differenc eincreased, the pollen ratio was higher up to a certain height difference when the ratio stabilizes (around 1.5). On the other hand, the standard deviation of the pollen ratio was greater for the traps closer to ground level. Therefore the height difference is a factor which explains the pollen ratio in conjunction with other variables such as the minimum height of the lower trap or the distance between the spore traps.\r\nThese findings are highly relevant to clinical practice, as the relationship between pollen exposure at ground level and monitored airborne pollen concentrations at roof-top elvel are determined. Thus, the optimal pollen monitoring height could be optimized based on these results",

      "abstract": "Pollen monitoring networks around the world are mainly based on rooftop-located stations on buildings. Thus, measured airborne pollen levels could be different from ground level, where most allergic individual reside. Until now, the effects of height of sampling on pollen concentration are not well documented. The aim of this meta-analysis was to analyse these effects using a large number of twin sampling stations.\r\nPollen data from 45 twin-stations Hirst-type volumetric spore traps were analyzed, with a maximum distance of 5km between the twin traps, from 25 different locations. To compare the effect of height, the mean of the daily ratio of the amounts of pollen registrered at different heights was used. The values of the lowest station were divided by the higher station. Stations between 1.5m and 50 agl were considered.\r\nThe results showed that the traps at lower height registered generally higher pollen concentration (average pollen ratio higher than 1), although the behaviour of the ratio differed per pollen type. For instance, both Poaceae and Betula showed that as the height differenc eincreased, the pollen ratio was higher up to a certain height difference when the ratio stabilizes (around 1.5). On the other hand, the standard deviation of the pollen ratio was greater for the traps closer to ground level. Therefore the height difference is a factor which explains the pollen ratio in conjunction with other variables such as the minimum height of the lower trap or the distance between the spore traps.\r\nThese findings are highly relevant to clinical practice, as the relationship between pollen exposure at ground level and monitored airborne pollen concentrations at roof-top elvel are determined. Thus, the optimal pollen monitoring height could be optimized based on these results",

Such participation has been championed by government, academics and SUAC groups from a range of theoretical and political perspectives. Most research into the effectiveness of SUAC involvement at HE has come from the perspectives of academics and very little SUAC-led research exists. This qualitative peer research was led by two members of the University of Worcester’s SUAC group. Findings were that SUAC perceived their involvement brought benefits to students, staff, the University and the local community. Significant personal benefits such as finding a new support network, increased self-development and greater confidence to manage their own care were identified in ways that suggested that the benefits that can flow from SUAC involvement at HE are perhaps more far-reaching than previously recognised. Barriers to inclusion were less than previously reported in the literature and the humanising effects of SUAC involvement are presented as a partial antidote to an increasingly marketised HE culture.",

      "rioxx2_description": "Academic staff perceptions of the value and purpose of service user and carer (SUAC) involvement within a health and social work faculty in an English university were explored in this co-produced qualitative study.   Relevant research findings over the past two decades were reviewed and two SUAC researchers, plus an academic member of staff, designed the study based around fifteen semi-structured telephone interviews. \r\nFindings were that staff were very positive about the benefits brought by SUAC involvement, in respect of their own grounding, knowledge, and continuing professional development (CPD), these findings not having previously been reflected in the literature. Barriers to involvement of SUACs were found to be negligible compared to those found in recent literature, and the input of SUACs appeared to be embraced by academic staff. This changing picture has emerged at a time when managerialism and marketization affect the working conditions of staff. In times of increasing workloads, this study suggested that academics find SUAC involvement both supportive and constructively challenging.  SUACs were perceived to bring fresh interdisciplinary knowledge and challenges to staff value bases alongside constructs of professionalism that staff may not be able to access elsewhere.  The encouragement of interdisciplinary ways of thinking was noted to have been a serendipitous consequence of SUACs from different backgrounds inputting on courses across the faculty. \r\nRecommendations are to better ensure consistency in the use of SUACs in terms of resourcing, support, and development if such involvement is to be meaningful rather than marginalised and de-valued.",

Through an analysis of the impact case studies submitted to the UK Research Excellence Framework (REF) this paper explores the types and beneficiaries of impact claimed by scholars in HRD cases within the Business and Management Unit of Assessment.  Societal impact with a wide range of beneficiaries was claimed by most scholars.  However further analysis revealed that the cases tended to take a unitarist perspective, ignoring potential negative impacts.  Moreover the key beneficiaries claimed were more likely to be organisations and individual learners already engaged in learning or in positions of relative power.  In line with this, learning and\/or performance discourses were identified in all cases.  These findings suggest that discourses presented in the impact case studies may be reinforcing existing power relations rather than responding to critical HRD’s call to challenge them, and encourage scholarly practitioners to be aware of the potential practical implications of these scholarly discourses.",

      "rioxx2_description": "The genus Leptosphaeria contains numerous fungi that cause the symptoms of asthma and also parasitize wild and crop plants. In search of a robust and universal forecast model, the ascospore concentration in air was measured and weather data recorded from 1 March to 31 October between 2006 and 2012. The experiment was conducted in three European countries of the temperate climate, i.e., Ukraine, Poland, and the UK. Out of over 150 forecast models produced using artificial neural networks (ANNs) and multivariate regression trees (MRTs), we selected the best model for each site, as well as for joint two-site combinations. The performance of all computed models was tested against records from 1 year which had not been used for model construction. The statistical analysis of the fungal spore data was supported by a comprehensive study of both climate and land cover within a 30-km radius from the air sampler location. High-performance forecasting models were obtained for individual sites, showing that the local micro-climate plays a decisive role in biology of the fungi. Based on the previous epidemiological studies, we hypothesized that dew point temperature (DPT) would be a critical factor in the models. The impact of DPT was confirmed only by one of the final best neural models, but the MRT analyses, similarly to the Spearman's rank test, indicated the importance of DPT in all but one of the studied cases and in half of them ranked it as a fundamental factor. This work applies artificial neural modeling to predict the Leptosphaeria airborne spore concentration in urban areas for the first time.",

The study investigated the concept of ‘inspiring’ and ‘inspirational’ teaching through recruiting a purposive sample of 17 primary and secondary school teachers in England drawn from\r\nnine schools in a single Multi-Academy Trust (MAT). The aim of the study was to integrate and synthesise evidence from a range of perspectives using multiple methods involving a combination of descriptive and numeric data, in order to increase knowledge and understanding of what it means to be ‘inspiring’ within the current educational landscape. The study fits with the ‘numbers and a narrative’ tradition reflecting the growing popularity of mixed methods (Gorard & Smith, 2006) and adopted an equal-status, sequential research design that comprised integration of multiple\r\nmethods including semi-structured interviews with teachers, classroom observations including both descriptive field notes and systematic observation schedules that tapped features associated with effective practice, numeric ranking sheets for teachers and head teachers and a student questionnaire survey that included rating scales and open-ended response questions. The findings reveal clear associations between effective and inspiring practice but also identify particular features that distinguish inspiring practitioners and their practice. Findings concerning the socio-emotional component are highlighted in particular in relation to the emphasis these teachers placed on creating positive relationships with students and a safe supportive classroom climate.",

      "rioxx2_description": "Cardiovascular disease is a highly prevalent issue worldwide, and one of its main manifestations, dyslipidaemia, needs more attention. Cooked artichoke (Cynara scolymus) hearts or artichoke leaf extract (ALE) are believed to be helpful in the treatment of dyslipidaemia. In this narrative review, we provide a brief overview of the potential impact of artichoke consumption on lipid profile. We appraised the Cochrane, MEDLINE and Web of Science databases, and included articles published between 2000 and June 2018 on intervention in humans only. The main potential of ALE administration observed on lipid profile relates to decreased serum LDL, total cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations, although no strong evidence for increasing HDL appears to exist. Evidence suggests that decreases of 8 to 49 mg\/dL for LDL concentration, 12 to 55 mg\/dL for total cholesterol, and 11 to 51 mg\/dL for triglycerides, can be attributed to 2-3 g\/d of ALE, in which its components luteolin and chlorogenic acid may play a key role. On the other hand, the effects of cooked artichoke hearts can be attributed mainly to its soluble fibres, particularly inulin. Despite the convincing evidence on its health benefits, additional long-term clinical trials are pivotal to fully elucidate the potential effects of ALE administration on positive cardiovascular outcomes",

      "rioxx2_description": "Aim\/Objective: Currently, there are 25 nations that recognise same-sex marriage. New Zealand is one of those countries, having passed its marriage equality legislation in 2013. Commensurate with that law change, lesbian and gay couples also became eligible to adopt as a couple, whereas prior to that, only married couples could adopt children in New Zealand. These global trends appear to be legitimising same-sex relationships. Yet, international research shows that despite statutory rights to marry—and by extension, adopt—same-sex couples continue to experience difficulties when trying to adopt, ostensibly perpetrated by biased adoption workers and agencies. For lesbian and gay couples, is winning their rights to legally marry merely the first step? Do same-sex couples also have to prepare themselves to battle individual and\/or agency biases in their quests to adoptive parents? That is the question at the heart of our project.\r\n\r\nMethod: All participants were recruited via professional bodies who advertised or passed along information about the study including a direct link to the online anonymous questionnaire. Completion of the survey signalled informed consent and no identifying information was collected from participants at any point in the questionnaire. Because studying attitudes and beliefs on socially sensitive topics are highly susceptible to social desirability, for our study we utilized multiple methods to assess and corroborate participants’ beliefs about placing children with same-sex parents. Data were collected using SurveyMonkey. The first part of the survey asked demographic questions such as age, gender, sexual orientation, religiosity, occupation, education, experience working directly with same-sex clients, etc. The second part of the survey obtained data on participants’ beliefs about lesbian and gay adoptions using 24 negative-meaning and positive-meaning statements on a 6-point Likert Scale (1 = Strongly Disagree, 6 = Strongly Agree). The last part of the survey involved the use of a vignette describing a prospective adoptive couple whose gender was ambiguous. Participants were then asked a series of questions based on the couple being male and the same questions for if the couple was female.\r\n\r\nResults: A total of 313 respondents completed at least part of the survey. The most pertinent descriptive and inferential results will be discussed. In brief, we found that respondents who were female, younger aged, non-religious, and held liberal political views were more supportive of gay and lesbian adoption.\r\n\r\nConclusions: Overall, our findings strongly mirror those of similar overseas studies. This will be briefly discussed. How the results affect same-sex adopters will also be discussed. Implications of the findings for adoption practice and training will be considered.

      "abstract": "Aim\/Objective: Currently, there are 25 nations that recognise same-sex marriage. New Zealand is one of those countries, having passed its marriage equality legislation in 2013. Commensurate with that law change, lesbian and gay couples also became eligible to adopt as a couple, whereas prior to that, only married couples could adopt children in New Zealand. These global trends appear to be legitimising same-sex relationships. Yet, international research shows that despite statutory rights to marry—and by extension, adopt—same-sex couples continue to experience difficulties when trying to adopt, ostensibly perpetrated by biased adoption workers and agencies. For lesbian and gay couples, is winning their rights to legally marry merely the first step? Do same-sex couples also have to prepare themselves to battle individual and\/or agency biases in their quests to adoptive parents?

      "rioxx2_description": "Artificial soils made from waste materials offer an alternative to imported natural topsoils, notably in large-scale groundwork and reclamation projects. Benefits include diversion of waste from landfill and recycling. Nonetheless, there is limited information on the characteristics needed to support plant growth in the long term, particularly the existence of a sustainable nitrogen reservoir. Therefore, we assessed the efficacy of nitrogen cycling and retention within an artificial soil composed of 25 sand, 10 clay, 32.5 composted bark and 32.5 composted green waste over 52 weeks. Leachate was analysed for nitrogen species and nitrogen concentrations, and two of the soil columns had fertiliser added after 26 and 48 weeks. Results show that nitrate concentrations decreased from 6.73 to 0.36 mg N L−1 after 2 weeks, due to poor retention of this anion in soil, and remained low for 6 months, before increasing up to 5.87 mg N L−1 after week 26. This sharp increase in dissolved nitrate was preceded by a decrease in the ratio of dissolved organic carbon to dissolved organic nitrogen in the soil leachate. This finding indicates that the soil had become carbon-limited, leading to mineralisation of organic nitrogen by soil organisms and excretion of nitrogen. We also found that fertilisation of the soil did not alleviate carbon limitation and nitrogen loss was greater in fertilised soils, indicating nitrogen saturation. After the onset of carbon limitation, the dissolved nitrate concentrations in both the fertilised and unfertilised soils were close to exceeding the European Union threshold of concern for nitrate groundwater and river pollution. Thus, while the deployment of artificial soils is a viable option for landscaping projects, loss of nitrogen may be environmentally significant and soil management protocols must take account of both the carbon and nitrogen status of the substrate. © 2017 Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature",

Here we present the first attempt to forecast amounts of Alternaria spores in Europe using the atmospheric dispersion and composition model SILAM, which already includes several pollen types . The final goal after the project is a real operational warning system, which would be able to predict large pest insect migrations and plant pathogen dispersion in regional and continental scales in Europe. \r\nAlternaria species are known as major plant pathogens. At least 20% of agricultural spoilage is caused by Alternaria species and the most severe losses may reach up to 80% of yield.  Alternaria is also a common allergen in humans and numerical, model based  forecasts that specify Alternaria could complement current forecasts.   \r\nA key tool in this study is the SILAM atmospheric dispersion model. The insect migration and plant pathogen model presented in this study will be constructed as a part of the SILAM modelling system. It includes both Lagrangian and Eulerian advection\/diffusion formulations and wet and dry depositions.\r\nSpore observations will be used   from the University of Turku, the University of Worcester and from the EAN database. \r\nThe atmospheric dispersion and concentration of spores are predictable using mathematical-physical-biological models in the same way as pollen concentrations are: maps of source areas and flowering parameters with a flowering model in the SILAM constitute pollen emissions. After pollen release, the pollen grains disperse in the air and removal processes remove them from the atmosphere. As a result, the model gives pollen concentrations in the air (see http:\/\/silam.fmi.fi). In the case of Alternaria spores, the source areas (e.g. crop fields and grass areas), timing of spore release   and favourable weather are the main parameters included in the model.   \r\n\r\nThis work demonstrates the possibility and limitations of using the dispersion model with pollen sources for the new type of biogenic aerosols - the Alternaria spores.",

It includes both Lagrangian and Eulerian advection\/diffusion formulations and wet and dry depositions.\r\nSpore observations will be used   from the University of Turku, the University of Worcester and from the EAN database. \r\nThe atmospheric dispersion and concentration of spores are predictable using mathematical-physical-biological models in the same way as pollen concentrations are: maps of source areas and flowering parameters with a flowering model in the SILAM constitute pollen emissions. After pollen release, the pollen grains disperse in the air and removal processes remove them from the atmosphere. As a result, the model gives pollen concentrations in the air (see http:\/\/silam.fmi.fi). In the case of Alternaria spores, the source areas (e.g. crop fields and grass areas), timing of spore release   and favourable weather are the main parameters included in the model.   \r\n\r\nThis work demonstrates the possibility and limitations of using the dispersion model with pollen sources for the new type of biogenic aerosols - the Alternaria spores.",

      "rioxx2_title": "Mapping Ragweed Presence in Europe Using Top-down and Bottom-up Approaches",
      "rioxx2_description": "Background: Common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia), originating from North America, is a key invasive species in Europe that produces large amounts of allergenic pollen. The SMARTER network (Sustainable Management of Ambrosia artemisiifolia in Europe), funded as a COST Action during 2012-17, address issues relating to ragweed management. A key aspect of the successful management is the accurate mapping of ragweed. This study provides the results of this mapping from the SMARTER network.\r\nMethods: Two methods for mapping ragweed were applied. Method 1 is the so-called top-down approach where infested ragweed habitats are based on a combination of expert knowledge, land cover data and calculated pollen integrals, here from 313 sites distributed over Europe. The infestation for each site is calculated and then spatially interpolated to European scale on a harmonized 10km x 10km grid. Method 2 is a bottom-up approach using geographically referenced ragweed occurrences, and abundances where available, in selected countries. These are also interpolated to the 10km x 10km grid. Each gridded data set is investigated and they are compared numerically.\r\nResults The pollen based map shows the largest ragweed infestation in Eastern Ukraine and parts of Russia. Large infestations are also found in the western part of the Pannonian Plain, particularly parts of Croatia and Serbia.

      "abstract": "Background: Common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia), originating from North America, is a key invasive species in Europe that produces large amounts of allergenic pollen. The SMARTER network (Sustainable Management of Ambrosia artemisiifolia in Europe), funded as a COST Action during 2012-17, address issues relating to ragweed management. A key aspect of the successful management is the accurate mapping of ragweed. This study provides the results of this mapping from the SMARTER network.\r\nMethods: Two methods for mapping ragweed were applied. Method 1 is the so-called top-down approach where infested ragweed habitats are based on a combination of expert knowledge, land cover data and calculated pollen integrals, here from 313 sites distributed over Europe. The infestation for each site is calculated and then spatially interpolated to European scale on a harmonized 10km x 10km grid. Method 2 is a bottom-up approach using geographically referenced ragweed occurrences, and abundances where available, in selected countries. These are also interpolated to the 10km x 10km grid. Each gridded data set is investigated and they are compared numerically.\r\nResults The pollen based map shows the largest ragweed infestation in Eastern Ukraine and parts of Russia. Large infestations are also found in the western part of the Pannonian Plain, particularly parts of Croatia and Serbia. France and Italy have substantially smaller areas of ragweed with high infestation and some infestation was identified in the European part of Turkey. Two maps of ragweed occurrences and abundances are provided for Serbia and Austria. Both countries show substantial variations throughout the country, with high densities in the Northern parts of Serbia and in eastern parts of Austria. \r\nDiscussion & Conclusion: The two approaches depict a similar spatial distribution of ragweed in these two countries, suggesting that both types of inventories are suitable as background data for managing ragweed. In cases where ragweed occurrence data are not available, the high congruence of the two approaches allows for the reliable prediction of high ragweed densities using the top-down approach.",

      "rioxx2_description": "This is lightly edited and referenced version of a presentation given at the 20th International Philosophy of Nursing conference in Quebec on 23rd August 2016.\r\nPhilosophical texts are not given the same prominence in nurse education as their more valued younger sibling, primary research evidence, but they can influence practice through guidelines, codes and espoused values.  John Stuart Mill’s harm principle, found in On Liberty, is not a universal law, and only a thoroughgoing libertarian would defend it as such, though it, or its remnants, can be seen can be seen in policy documents. But its influence is weakening. Smoking bans in enclosed spaces were initially justified with other-regarding considerations, but judgements from unsuccessful legal challenges from patients in UK psychiatric hospitals rely on preventing harm to the smoker, even when smoking outside, which does not harm others. In the wake of legislation, no-smoking policies enacted by hospitals are becoming more aggressive, banning smoking both inside and outside, and extending the use of power gained through employment to prevent nurses assisting patients enjoy a lawful habit. Mill’s dictum has been subverted, and this speaks to the fundamental purpose of nursing.  Should nurses collude and willingly exert their power for their version of the good of the patient? Or should they instead reaffirm values that support and facilitate life choices made by autonomous people? The paper supports the latter option, and this has wider application for nursing which can be illuminated, if not settled, by revisiting Mill and his famous dictum.",

      "abstract": "This is lightly edited and referenced version of a presentation given at the 20th International Philosophy of Nursing conference in Quebec on 23rd August 2016.\r\nPhilosophical texts are not given the same prominence in nurse education as their more valued younger sibling, primary research evidence, but they can influence practice through guidelines, codes and espoused values.  John Stuart Mill’s harm principle, found in On Liberty, is not a universal law, and only a thoroughgoing libertarian would defend it as such, though it, or its remnants, can be seen can be seen in policy documents. But its influence is weakening. Smoking bans in enclosed spaces were initially justified with other-regarding considerations, but judgements from unsuccessful legal challenges from patients in UK psychiatric hospitals rely on preventing harm to the smoker, even when smoking outside, which does not harm others. In the wake of legislation, no-smoking policies enacted by hospitals are becoming more aggressive, banning smoking both inside and outside, and extending the use of power gained through employment to prevent nurses assisting patients enjoy a lawful habit. Mill’s dictum has been subverted, and this speaks to the fundamental purpose of nursing.  Should nurses collude and willingly exert their power for their version of the good of the patient? Or should they instead reaffirm values that support and facilitate life choices made by autonomous people? The paper supports the latter option, and this has wider application for nursing which can be illuminated, if not settled, by revisiting Mill and his famous dictum.",

      "referencetext": "“In How to Wear Grunge, Ruth Stacey has achieved a bittersweet examination of brutal youth and violent love, with expert attention to the timing of acceptance, obsession and revelation. There’s almost a contact-high to these poems, an intoxication that has been carefully crafted to provide relief from the horrors of the past and of each other, creating a deceptively fragile romance of a sub-culture that encouraged the dirt and distortion of the fragmented self. However, once we have questioned the lives of the damaged, haunted souls in this cool as hell collection, what burns through is strength and survival, wounds that gush with the language of dark joy, the sweet stink of dope and incense, a promise (to past, present and future selves) tightly rolled into a joint so full of flavour it will leave your mouth watering. How to Wear Grunge is ultimately a kaleidoscopic questionnaire. There are no right or wrong answers. In the end, we all dance to something. We make noise, we hurt each other and, sometimes, we forgive.”\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n– Bobby Parker",

Within the framework of the JPND-MEETINGDEM implementation project the pathways to regular day-care activities and the Meeting Centers Support Programme (MCSP), an innovative combined support form for people with dementia and carers, was explored. An exploratory, descriptive, qualitative, cross-country design was applied to investigate the pathways to day care in several regions in four European countries (Italy, Poland, United Kingdom, and the Netherlands).

      "rioxx2_description": "To date, there have been few studies with victims of stalking in the United Kingdom, and this is the first to have been conducted following the clarification of stalking as a criminal offense in 2012. In 2016, Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary Fire and Rescue Services (HMICFRS) and Her Majesty’s Crown Prosecution Inspectorate (HMCPSI) announced the first ever inspection into harassment and stalking in England and Wales. This article presents research commissioned by HMICFRS as part of the inspection. In particular, we explore how victims described the response of the police and situate this within the context of changing legislation and previous research in the field. In total, 35 people shared their experiences of reporting harassment and stalking, 14 people completed an online survey, and 21 participants were interviewed. Responses were analyzed thematically and a series of themes were identified. The analysis suggests that despite the clarification of stalking as a criminal office in 2012, the majority of participants described poor responses from the police—with many describing police inaction, or inappropriate action—in addition to feeling blamed and not being taken seriously. The article considers possible explanations for these issues and concludes by calling for harassment and stalking legislation in England and Wales to be clarified, and for police training to shift the focus of the investigation from the behavior of the offender, to the emotional impact on the victim.",

This article presents research commissioned by HMICFRS as part of the inspection. In particular, we explore how victims described the response of the police and situate this within the context of changing legislation and previous research in the field. In total, 35 people shared their experiences of reporting harassment and stalking, 14 people completed an online survey, and 21 participants were interviewed. Responses were analyzed thematically and a series of themes were identified. The analysis suggests that despite the clarification of stalking as a criminal office in 2012, the majority of participants described poor responses from the police—with many describing police inaction, or inappropriate action—in addition to feeling blamed and not being taken seriously. The article considers possible explanations for these issues and concludes by calling for harassment and stalking legislation in England and Wales to be clarified, and for police training to shift the focus of the investigation from the behavior of the offender, to the emotional impact on the victim.",

Freshwater ecosystems are found throughout agricultural and urban landscapes and provide a wide range of ecosystem services, but globally they are also amongst the most vulnerable. In particular, ponds (lentic waters typically less than 2ha), provide natural flood management, sequester carbon and hold significant cultural value. However, to inform their management it is important to understand a) how functional diversity varies in response to disturbance and b) the link between biodiversity conservation and ecosystem function.\r\nIn this study, a meta-analysis of seven separate pond studies from across England and Wales was carried out to explore the effect of urban and agricultural land-use gradients, shading, emergent vegetation, surface area and pH upon groups of functionally similar members of the macroinvertebrate fauna. Functional effect groups were first identified by carrying out a hierarchical cluster analysis using body size, voltinism and feeding habits (18 categories) that are closely related to biogeochemical processes (e.g. nutrient and carbon recycling). Secondly, the influence of the gradients upon effect group membership (functional redundancy - FR) and the breadth of traits available to aid ecosystem recovery (response diversity) was assessed using species counts and functional dispersion (FDis) using 12 response traits. The effect of land-use gradients was unpredictable, whilst there was a negative response in both FR and FDis to shading and positive responses to increases in emergent vegetation cover and surface area. An inconsistent association between FDis and FR suggested that arguments for taxonomic biodiversity conservation in order to augment ecosystem functioning are too simplistic. Thus, a deeper understanding of the response of functional diversity to disturbance could have greater impact with decision-makers who may relate better to the loss of ecosystem function in response to environmental degradation than species loss alone.",

Investigation of factors preceding and accompanying these effects may facilitate the identification of the underlying biological\r\nmechanisms. This exploratory study aimed to examine clinical and genetic factors predicting response to SD and determine the impact of SD on illness course. Mood during SD was also assessed via visual analogue scale. Depressed inpatients (n = 78) and healthy controls (n = 15) underwent ~36 h of SD. Response to SD was defined as a score of ≤ 2 on the Clinical Global Impression\r\nScale for Global Improvement. Depressive symptom trajectories were evaluated for up to a month using self\/expert ratings. Impact of genetic burden was calculated using polygenic risk scores for major depressive disorder. In total, 72% of patients responded to SD. Responders and non-responders did not differ in baseline self\/expert depression symptom ratings, but mood differed. Response was associated with lower age (p = 0.007) and later age at life-time disease onset (p = 0.003). Higher genetic burden of depression\r\nwas observed in non-responders than healthy controls. Up to a month post SD, depressive symptoms decreased in both patients groups, but more in responders, in whom effects were sustained.

      "rioxx2_description": "Children whose parents are involved in the criminal justice system (CJS) are at increased risk of developing social, emotional, and behavioural difficulties and are more likely than their peers to become involved in the CJS themselves. Parenting behaviour and parent-child relationships have the potential to affect children’s outcomes with positive parenting practices having the potential to moderate some of the negative outcomes associated with parental involvement in the CJS. However, many parents in the CJS may lack appropriate role models to support the development of positive parenting beliefs and practices. Parenting programs offer an opportunity for parents to enhance their parenting knowledge and behaviours and improve relationships with children. Quantitative and qualitative evidence pertaining to the implementation and effectiveness of parenting programs delivered in the CJS was included. Five databases were searched and a total of 1145 articles were identified of which 29 met the review inclusion criteria. Overall, programs were found to significantly improve parenting attitudes; however, evidence of wider effects is limited. Additionally, the findings indicate that parenting programs can be meaningful for parents. Despite this, a number of challenges for implementation were found including the transient nature of the prison population and a lack of parent-child contact. Based on these findings, recommendations for the future development and delivery of programs are discussed.",

Intensifying treatment to increase patient retention is a promising development. Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of an intensive trauma-focused treatment programme over 8 days for individuals suffering from severe PTSD. Method: Treatment was provided for 347 PTSD patients (70% women; mean age = 38.32 years, SD = 11.69) and consisted of daily sessions of prolonged exposure and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) therapy (16 sessions in total), physical activity, and psycho-education. All participants had experienced multiple traumas, including sexual abuse (74.4%), and suffered from multiple comorbidities (e.g. 87.5% had a mood disorder). Suicidal ideation was frequent (73.9%). PTSD symptom severity was assessed by both clinician-rated [Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS)] and self-report [PTSD Symptom Scale Self Report (PSS-SR) and Impact of Event Scale (IES)] inventories. For a subsample (n = 109), follow-up data at 6 months were available. Results: A significant decline in symptom severity was found (e.g. CAPS intention-to-treat sample Cohen’s d = 1.64). At post-treatment, 82.9% showed a clinically meaningful response and 54.9% a loss of diagnosis. Dropout was very low (2.3%).

Over a 6 week period, 12 male junior basketball players who played in the\r\nSpanish national under-18 League, played 7 games of one-a-side (1v1), 6 games of two-aside\r\n(2v2), 8 games of five-a-side (5v5), and 5 games of superiority (3v2) situations. During\r\n1v1, 2v2, 5v5, and 3v2 peak heart rates were 90.27 ± 3.37%, 92.68 ± 3.29%, 92.01 ± 3.48%,\r\nand 88.74 ± 5.77% of HRmax respectively. These differences were statistically significant\r\nbetween 1v1 and 2v2 (P<0.01), 1v1 and 5v5 (P<0.05), 2v2 and 3v2 (P<0.001), and 5v5 and\r\n3v2 (P<0.001). Mean heart rate was 79.5 ± 4.4%, 83.1 ± 4.2%, 91.2 ± 4.7%, and 78.5 ± 7.5%\r\nof HRmax during 1v1, 2v2, 5v5, and 3v2, respectively, and differences were observed\r\nbetween 1v1 and 2v2 (P<0.001), 2v2 and 3v2 (P<0.001), and 5v5 and 3v2 (P<0.05). There\r\nwere differences in athletes and coaches in-task RPE in all SSGs (all P<0.0001 apart from\r\n5x5 P=0.0019). The 2v2 format elicited a higher mean in-task RPE in comparison to all\r\nother SSGs (P<0.001), possibly because 2v2 imposes a greater cognitive load.",

The idea emerged through the success of the #BYOD4Lchat, a daily feature of the 5-day openly-licensed course Bring Your Own Devices for Learning (BYOD4L), first offered in January 2014 and based on flexible, distance and online learning (FDOL) Offered Monday to Friday from 8-9pm UK time #BYOD4Lchat always created a real buzz. Chrissi saw the potential for a tweetchat on its own, outside a course that would have the potential to develop a community around it. Courses have such a short lifespan, she thought. What about a community approach to professional development? If we want our academics engaged in ongoing professional development could a weekly tweetchat be an attractive option? Could it work? She wanted to give it a go! When the idea matured a little bit in her head, she shared it with Sue Beckingham over a Skype meeting and then with Dr. David Walker and Peter Reed in an email signing as Chrissi and Sue. She wanted the tweetchat to become a truly collaborative project from the outset and therefore creating the conditions for co-ownership were important to her. The Learning and Teaching in Higher Education tweetchat, or #LTHEchat, came to live. The name came from a core module Chrissi led while working at the University of Salford. Chrissi, Sue, David and Peter became the steering group and decided to run a 3-month pilot and see how it went.",

      "rioxx2_description": "The aim of this study was to determine the inter-rater reliability between one expert-nurse and four clinical-nurses who were asked to clinically assess infection of chronic wounds by using the World Union of Wound Healing Societies (WUWHS) criteria. A quasi-experimental design was used to collect the data. In comparison to phase 1 in which ‘open questions’ were asked, in phase 2 a pre-printed form (checklist) was introduced. In both phases, 55 chronic wounds were clinically assessed. For each WUWHS criterion the inter-rater reliability of signs and symptoms was expressed by Cohens Kappa (κ). A substantial agreement (κ ≥ 0·6) was considered as adequate. In both phases pocketing (p < 0·02), and erythema (p < 0·004) scored statistically significant results. Phase 2 showed higher inter-rater agreements compared with phase 1 (three substantial agreements (easily bleeding\/friable granulation tissue, delayed healing, increasing exudate), an almost perfect- and a perfect agreement for malodour and pain, respectively. According to the results it can be concluded that the clinical assessment of infection of chronic wounds may be better supported by a pre-printed form than making use of an ‘open questions’ form. To provide this with a higher level of evidence, there is need for more well conducted studies. © 2017 Medicalhelplines.com Inc and John Wiley & Sons Ltd",

      "rioxx2_description": "The purpose of this study was to compare the standardized relative distance covered by the various playing positions (defenders, midfielders and forwards) against different quality of opponents in domestic women’s field hockey.  Data were collected from 13 individuals competing for one team in the English Premier League across an 18-game season.  Data were collected via portable global positioning system technology.  Distance data were grouped into six speed zones relative to individual players’ maximum sprint speeds and then standardized by dividing by the number of on-pitch minutes. Dependent variables included distance covered in the six speed zones, as well as the number of sprints and repeated sprint efforts completed in the highest speed zone.  Participants covered a significantly greater total distance when competing against opponents from top three teams compared to middle three teams (111.78 ± 2.65m·min-1 vs. 107.35 ± 2.62m·min-1 respectively). This was also true for distance covered in Zone 4 (running) (29.47 ± 1.69m·min-1 vs. 27.62 ± 1.45m·min-1, respectively) and Zone 5 (fast running) (23.42 ± 1.76m·min-1 vs 21.52 ± 1.79m·min-1, respectively).  Defenders (99.77 ± 4.36m·min-1) covered significantly less total metres per minute than midfielders (117.20 ± 4.36 m·min-1) and completed significantly fewer Repeated Sprint Efforts per on-pitch minute (0.21 ± 0.03; 0.33 ± 0.03 respectively).  Midfielders covered significantly less distance in Zone 2 (walking) than forwards (19.38 ± 1.64m·min-1; 30.33 ± 2.12m·min-1 respectively).  Conversely, midfielders were shown to cover significantly more distance in Zone 3 (jogging) than forwards (32.84 ± 1.10m·min-1; 24.61 ± 1.42m·min-1 respectively).  A standardized and relative assessment may be useful for coaches’ and performance analysts’ understanding of players’ performance in different positions or against different quality opponents.",

The absorption of light in water also complicates the use of common image analysis methods. This paper presents the results of a study that uses very high resolution (VHR) image data, collected with a Near Infrared sensitive DSLR camera, to map the distribution of SAV species for three sites along the Desselse Nete, a lowland river in Flanders, Belgium. Plant species, including Ranunculus aquatilis L., Callitriche obtusangula Le Gall, Potamogeton natans L., Sparganium emersum L. and Potamogeton crispus L., were classified from the data using Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) and expert knowledge. A classification rule set based on a combination of both spectral and structural image variation (e.g. texture and shape) was developed for images from two sites. A comparison of the classifications with manually delineated ground truth maps resulted for both sites in 61% overall accuracy. Application of the rule set to a third validation image, resulted in 53% overall accuracy. These consistent results show promise for species level mapping in such biodiverse environments, but also prompt a discussion on assessment of classification accuracy.",

      "rioxx2_description": "Acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) is a type of myeloid malignancy defined by the chromosomal translocation t(15;17) and subsequent expression of the PML-RARα fusion protein. Long term remission in APL is achieved through a combination of high dose all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and arsenic trioxide (ATO), the latter of which has potential to induce mitochondrial derived oxidative stress and initiate the intrinsic apoptosis pathway. ATO is particularly effective in the treatment of APL when compared with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), suggesting that the mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) of APL cells is compromised. Here we show that loss of Δψm is associated with intracellular thiol oxidation and disease progression in APL.\r\n\r\nThe mitochondrial probe 3,3'-diethyloxacrbocyanine iodide (DiOC2(3)) was used to evaluate MRP8-PML\/RARA transgenic mice Δψm in bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMC) at three disease stages: 1) pre-APL, 2) APL and 3) ATRA treated APL. Our data show that MRP8-PML\/RARA BMMC cells during the APL stage accumulate significantly less DiOC2(3) compared with pre-APL cells (0.05±0.02 vs 0.24±0.05, p<0.05; data are normalised FL1\/FL3 MFI ratio). The DiOC2(3) accumulation in BMMC from ATRA treated APL mice was equivalent to that of pre-APL cells (p>0.05). This finding indicates a loss of Δψm in APL. This may result in free radical leakage from the mitochondria, which in turn could oxidise intracellular thiols.\r\n\r\nTo evaluate intracellular thiol oxidation, a previously optimised flow cytometric assay that incorporates the thiol reactive probe fluorescein-5 maleimide (F5M) was used. Our data show a significant decrease in F5M MFI for MRP8-PML\/RARA BMMC cells during the APL stage, compared with pre-APL cells (219.01±47.67 vs 672.66±131.04, p<0.05; data are F5M MFI relative to unstained controls). This finding signifies that there is more thiol oxidation at the APL stage. ATRA treated APL mice showed an equivalent F5M MFI to that of pre-APL cells. Confocal microscopy confirmed that the F5M signal was intracellular. This observation shows that there is an increase in intracellular thiol oxidation in APL, which may be tracked during disease progression and treatment course. This finding may explain why APL cells are more sensitive to pro-oxidant treatments i.e. ATO.\r\n\r\nTo understand these observations further, the APL cell line (NB4) was subjected to glucose oxidase (GOX) mediated oxidative stress in cell culture over a 4 hour time-course. F5M MFI signal was compared with the THP1 and Kasumi-1 AML cell lines subjected to the same treatment. All cell lines showed similar significant increases in F5M MFI after 1 hour GOX treatment relative to control (p<0.05), indicating an increase in 'reduced' cellular thiol i.e. reductive stress. However, after 4 hours NB4 cells showed a significant decrease in F5M MFI relative to control (p<0.05), indicating an increase in 'oxidised' cellular thiol i.e. oxidative stress. In contrast, THP1 cells showed no difference in MFI after 4 hours (p>0.05), whereas F5M MFI Kasumi-1 remained significantly increased after 4 hours (p<0.05) relative to control. This finding indicates differences in the sensitivity to oxidative stress between APL and AML cells.\r\n\r\nTaken together, this study shows that APL cells are more sensitive to oxidative stress compared with AML cells. Our F5M flow cytometric assay illustrates that an increase in cellular thiol oxidation is linked to disease progression in APL, with loss of Δψm associated with this process. Our F5M flow cytometric assay may therefore have clinical utility in monitoring treatment efficacy in APL.",

PBMCs were isolated and reduced thiol analysis (fluorescein-5 maleimide (F5M)) by immunophenotype (CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+) was performed using flow cytometry. A significant increase in cellular F5M fluorescence was observed in CD3+ T-cells at POST+0, with changes driven to a greater extent by CD8+ T-cells (fold change in both groups CD4: +2.3, CD8: +2.8; p<0.05). Further analysis revealed a population of highly reduced CD8+ T-cells (CD8+T-reduced+) that significantly increased from PRE to POST+0 in RA participants only (RA: +272 cell\/µL, p<0.05). To further understand these results, CD8+T-reduced+ and CD8+T-reduced- cells were analysed for immunophenotype in response to the same exercise protocol (n=6, mean {plus minus} SD: age 24 {plus minus} 5 years; BMI 25.7 {plus minus} 4.1 kg·m-2; VO2max 41.33 {plus minus} 7.63 ml·kg-1·min-1).

There has been little development in these methodologies since that time, a period that has witnessed huge technological advances, particularly with the emergence of digital multi-parameter flow cytometric systems.  Concurrent advancement in our understanding of redox regulation within eukaryotic cellular systems has also followed, whereby it is now accepted that cysteine thiols partake in redox reactions, which regulate protein activity and function [2,3]. Moreover, we are at the dawn of a new era in redox biology whereby the importance of ‘reductive stress’ in eukaryotic cellular systems is gathering momentum [4].  It is therefore critical that methods be continually advanced to better understand these concepts in more detail at the cellular level.  Flow cytometry is a powerful technique that may be used for this purpose.  Henceforth we have rejuvenated these methods to address modern scientific questions.

      "rioxx2_description": "Whilst mental disorders can be disabling they are also treatable, yet engagement with services is often poor and disengagement from treatment is a major concern for mental health nurses. Participants were service users typically perceived as the most disengaged from mental health services, yet they were willing to engage in the research interviews. The seven participants were all male with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, a history of disengagement from mental health services and described their ethnicity as ‘black’. Participants were under the care of Assertive Outreach Teams and were recruited after the researcher was introduced to them by clinicians who were working with them. After ethical approval, in‐depth, semi‐structured interviews were used to elicit the experiences of participants. Through interpretative phenomenological analysis, themes were developed. Interpretative Phenomenological analysis generated four themes: (i) “People just keep hounding me”, (ii) Antipathy to Medication, (iii) Choice and the value of services, (iv) Stigmatisation and identity. By rigorously examining how service users with schizophrenia make sense of their experience of their relationship with mental health services, there is potential to give voice to the experiences of the recipients of mental health services. This study uncovered the complex nature of disengagement and in view of this there may never be a straightforward mechanism developed to engage all people with schizophrenia with mental health services. When the participants’ experiences are considered in a broader social context it may be possible to reflect on how services can be adapted to facilitate better engagement.",

This study aimed to develop an in-depth understanding of the\r\nway in which adults with CMT think about their health-related quality of life and the factors which\r\ninfluence this, in order to make recommendations for developing methods of appropriate\r\nassessment and intervention.",

The demographic comprising ECEC students remains highly gendered. Fuller, (2016 p.12) suggests that women are subject to a 'subversive cultural hegemony’ which affords them freedom to participate in higher education, though not freedom from gendered norms and expectations. Kass, (2015) highlights a marked difference in perceived self-efficacy amongst educators according to their gender. The QAA (2014) benchmarks for Early Childhood Studies degrees require students to act as advocates for children, their parents and families, but initial findings suggested that students lacked confidence in their abilities to do this, even avoiding opportunities where they arose. The research adopted a social constructivist, feminist perspective. A community of practice (Wenger, 2000) and workshops influenced by Ryan and Deci’s (2000) theory of intrinsic motivation were co-constructed with student participants. Qualitative methods were employed to collect data. The research proposals were scrutinised by a University Ethics Committee underpinned by a protocol which included strategies for participation and withdrawal by participants. Findings supported the notion of the affective as a potential barrier to learning. It is contended that such a barrier might be mitigated by specific learning and teaching strategies and an overt focus on structural and socio-cultural imbalances of power in ECEC\r\nKeywords: confidence, women, power-imbalances, professionalism, self-efficacy",

      "rioxx2_description": "The films Alice in Wonderland (2010) directed by Tim Burton and Paddington (2014) directed by Paul King, are re-workings of two established and well-known English children’s books. The contemporary re-birth of these texts as films make extensive use of digital techniques which visually and ideologically take the texts in new directions. A central consideration which arises on analysis of these films is the re-construction and re-positioning of the characters of nineteenth-century Alice and twentieth century Paddington in the digital age of the twenty-first century. Both Alice and Paddington are migrants: Alice into the fantasy world of Burton’s ‘Underland’ and Paddington the anthropomorphized bear who travels from the rain forests of Peru to central London. Each of these box office successes has an underlying theme of the experience of the migrant. Notably both films were released when migration and immigration were, and unfortunately still are, bitterly divisive subjects in the UK, Europe and America. This chapter analyses the experiences of the migrant characters and the influence of digital film making upon such construction. The case is made that literature for children when translated into media formats has ideological and moral themes relevant to the contemporary world.",

The work of all of these writers is defined as fantasy, yet there is a strong relationship with the social and political realities of the times. For example, the influences of Romanticism, Darwinism and Social Darwinism pulse through their texts culminating in the elements of Modernism in the twentieth century. The discussion takes the position that no literary and\/or philosophical movement begins or ends abruptly nor in a singular way, but that thinking develops and crosses over demonstrating the complexity of seemingly simple writing for children.",

      "abstract": "This chapter focusses on the links and developments in thinking from the nineteenth to the twentieth century in the work of Charles Kingsley, Lewis Carroll, and George MacDonald leading to the Inklings. The work of all of these writers is defined as fantasy, yet there is a strong relationship with the social and political realities of the times. For example, the influences of Romanticism, Darwinism and Social Darwinism pulse through their texts culminating in the elements of Modernism in the twentieth century. The discussion takes the position that no literary and\/or philosophical movement begins or ends abruptly nor in a singular way, but that thinking develops and crosses over demonstrating the complexity of seemingly simple writing for children.",

      "rioxx2_description": "Background: Spiritual care is a fundamental component of holistic end-of-life (EoL) care. Aim: To explore what is known about the spiritual concerns of people experiencing homelessness towards the EoL. Methods: A narrative literature review was conducted from 1997 to June 2018 using CINAHL Complete, MEDLINE and PubMed. This identified just 11 relevant papers; eight papers report on studies based in the US, one paper reports on a study based in the Republic of Ireland (ROI), and two of the papers are literature reviews. Results: Both the ROI and US studies report the primacy of religious beliefs and spiritual experience for people experiencing homelessness considering EoL issues. However, the findings of studies from the US and the ROI are not necessarily transferable to the other populations of people experiencing homelessness. Furthermore, it cannot be assumed that the spiritual needs of people experiencing homelessness mirror those of the housed population. Conclusion: There is a need for further research into the international perspective on the spiritual needs of homeless people towards the EoL, especially in secular countries.

      "abstract": "Background: Spiritual care is a fundamental component of holistic end-of-life (EoL) care. Aim: To explore what is known about the spiritual concerns of people experiencing homelessness towards the EoL. Methods: A narrative literature review was conducted from 1997 to June 2018 using CINAHL Complete, MEDLINE and PubMed. This identified just 11 relevant papers; eight papers report on studies based in the US, one paper reports on a study based in the Republic of Ireland (ROI), and two of the papers are literature reviews. Results: Both the ROI and US studies report the primacy of religious beliefs and spiritual experience for people experiencing homelessness considering EoL issues. However, the findings of studies from the US and the ROI are not necessarily transferable to the other populations of people experiencing homelessness. Furthermore, it cannot be assumed that the spiritual needs of people experiencing homelessness mirror those of the housed population. Conclusion: There is a need for further research into the international perspective on the spiritual needs of homeless people towards the EoL, especially in secular countries.

Buffer strips are usually established using grass-only seed mixes, or through natural regeneration.

In a 5-year study across three different sites we investigated the responses of 32 different\r\nforb species sown in two different grass-based seed mixes tailored to soil type. Generally, there was an increase in sown forb cover with time, and this effect was greatest in plots sown with fine-grasses treated with an application of graminicide or an annual cut.

      "rioxx2_description": "This study adopted an interpretive qualitative approach, using narrative inquiry to understand the experiences of early career physical education (PE) teachers who took ‘risks’ during their training year, and who had been teaching in schools. Narrative interviews were conducted with nine PE teachers who had engaged with a Risk-Taking Professional Development Programme (PDP) during their training year and who had been teaching for between two months and five years. Interviews explored the meanings, definitions and influences that participants ascribed to risk taking from their memories of the training year and once they began teaching in schools.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe focus of the study emerged because in my role as a PE teacher trainer, I designed the Risk-Taking PDP to challenge trainee PE teachers to reflect critically upon their teaching and pupil learning and, move beyond their comfortable practices. Inspiration was taken from the Office for Standards in Education outstanding descriptor at that time, to ‘Take risks when trying to make teaching interesting, be able to deal with the unexpected and grab the moment’ (Ofsted, 2008, p. 1). The Risk-Taking PDP became a core component of the PE Teacher Training course in one UK Higher Education Institution (HEI) and was delivered to over 100 PE trainee teachers.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn interpretive analysis located overlapping and interlocking themes which closely represented illuminative epiphanies (Denzin, 2001). Findings revealed that risk-taking became a central component of teachers’ practice during the training year. It encouraged critical reflection and developed trainee confidence. Epiphanic moments experienced by participants highlighted that adaptation, negotiation and resilience formed over time as crucial aspects of risk-taking. Once qualified and teaching in schools, key influences affected PE teachers’ willingness to take risks. These included; performativity measures, time, pupil behaviour and the influence of the subject community. Risk-taking was found to support personal and professional growth and, when influences in schools were positive, engagement with innovation and creativity continued. This led to further growth and learning for both teachers and pupils.\r\n \r\nThis study provides new knowledge to inform the continuation of the Risk-Taking PDP and offers new insights for PE Initial Teacher Education and Training (ITET) practices. Furthermore, this study reaffirms the views of Clandinin and Connelly (2000) who argue for narrative being a three-dimensional space where temporality, sociality and place (context) influence thinking and learning and also, those of Dewey (1938) where experience and learning is transactional and always in relation to others and the social context. This study proposes a fourth dimension to risk-taking, a visional dimension where teachers visualise an ‘ideal’ situation and, is represented through the abstract conceptualisation of risk-taking holding a four-dimensional metaphorical space. This is represented through a geometrical shape, the Tesseract. This study suggests that the Tesseract Model should be utilised in schools to support early career teacher professional development, build resilience and encourage collaborative engagement in subject communities. Likewise, insights from a methodological approach, of narrative inquiry, that has seen a limited application in the context of PE provides a different and invaluable viewpoint in positioning the researchers’ and participants’ stories centrally.",

      "rioxx2_description": "Blackcurrant is high in anthocyanin content. We have shown enhanced whole-body fat oxidation and increased time trial performance during cycling, in addition to increased femoral artery diameter during a sustained submaximal isometric contraction of the m.quadriceps with intake of New Zealand blackcurrant (NZBC) extract in normobaric normoxia (Cook et al., 2015, 2017). The effect of blackcurrant on metabolic and physiological responses and performance during cycling in normobaric hypoxia are not known. PURPOSE: To examine the effect of NZBC extract on intensity-dependent physiological and metabolic responses and 16.1-km cycling time trial in trained cyclists in normobaric hypoxia. METHODS: The study used a double-blind randomized cross-over design. Eleven healthy men from cycling and triathlon clubs with at least 3 yrs experience and cycling 8-10 hr·wk−1 (age: 38±11 yrs, height: 179±4 cm, body mass: 76±8 kg, V̇O2max: 47±5 mL·kg−1·min−1, maximum power: 398±38 W, mean±SD) ingested NZBC extract (600 mg·day−1 containing 220 mg anthocyanins) or placebo (PL) for 7 days (washout 14 days). Participants performed bouts of 10 min at 45, 55 and 65% V̇O2max, using indirect calorimetry and blood sampling, followed by a 16.1 km timetrial on a SRM ergometer (SRM International, Germany). Participants were familiarized for the time-trial. All testing took place in a temperature controlled (15°C) normobaric hypoxic chamber set at an altitude of ~2500 m (15% FiO2) (TIS Services, Medstead, UK) in morning sessions. Data was analysed using paired t-tests. RESULTS: At each intensity, NZBC extract had no effect on metabolic and physiological responses (e.g. at 65% V̇O2max, heart rate - PL: 133±12, NZBC; 132±12 beats·min-1); fat oxidation - PL: 0.24±0.12, NZBC: 0.20±0.16 g·min-1; carbohydrate oxidation - PL: 2.34±0.42, NZBC: 2.48±0.35 g·min-1; lactate - PL: 1.37±0.45, NZBC: 1.56±0.57 mmol·L-1). No improvements in 16.1 km time-trial performance were observed (PL: 1685±92, NZBC: 1685±99 sec). CONCLUSION: Seven day intake of New Zealand blackcurrant extract does not change whole-body fat oxidation and 16.1 km time-trial performance during cycling in normobaric hypoxia.",

This systematic narrative review aimed to systematically, and narratively, review robust evidence from Randomized-Controlled Trials examining the efficacy of EMDR therapy.\r\n\r\nMethod: Eight databases were searched to identify studies relevant to the study aim. Two separate systematic searches of published, peer-reviewed evidence were carried out, considering relevant studies published prior to April 2017. After exclusion of all irrelevant, or non-robust, studies, a total of two meta-analyses and four Randomized-Controlled Trials were included for review.\r\n\r\nResults: Data from meta-analyses and Randomized-Controlled Trials included in this review evidence the efficacy of EMDR therapy as a treatment for PTSD. Specifically, EMDR therapy improved PTSD diagnosis, reduced PTSD symptoms, and reduced other trauma-related symptoms. EMDR therapy was evidenced as being more effective than other trauma treatments, and was shown to be an effective therapy when delivered with different cultures. However, limitations to the current evidence exist, and much current evidence relies on small sample sizes and provides limited follow-up data.\r\n\r\nConclusions: This systematic narrative review contributes to the current evidence base, and provides recommendations for practice and future research. This review highlights the need for additional research to further examine the use of EMDR therapy for PTSD in a range of clinical populations and cultural contexts.",

      "rioxx2_description": "Subaerial particle size data holds a wealth of valuable information for fluvial, coastal, glacial and other sedimentological applications. Recently, we have gained the opportunity to map and quantify particle sizes at the mesoscale using data derived from small unmanned aerial system (sUAS) imagery processed using structure from motion (SfM) photogrammetry. These sUAS-SfM approaches have been based typically on calibrating orthoimage texture or point cloud roughness with particle size. Variable levels of success are reported and a single, robust method capable of producing consistently accurate and precise results in a range of settings has remained elusive. In this paper, we develop an original method for particle size mapping with the specific constraints of sUAS and SfM in mind. This method uses the texture of single sUAS images, rather than orthoimages, calibrated with particle sizes normalised by individual image scale. We compare results against existing orthoimage texture and roughness approaches, and provide the first quantitative investigation into the implications of the use of sUAS camera gimbals. Our results indicate that our novel single image method delivers the optimal particle size mapping performance for our study site, outperforming both other methods and delivering residual mean errors of 0.02mm (accuracy), standard deviation of residual errors of 6.90mm (precision) and maximum residual errors of 16.50mm. Accuracy values are more than two orders of magnitude worse when a camera gimbal is not used, thereby demonstrating the critical importance of mechanical image stabilisation for particle size mapping using measures of image texture.",

      "abstract": "Subaerial particle size data holds a wealth of valuable information for fluvial, coastal, glacial and other sedimentological applications. Recently, we have gained the opportunity to map and quantify particle sizes at the mesoscale using data derived from small unmanned aerial system (sUAS) imagery processed using structure from motion (SfM) photogrammetry. These sUAS-SfM approaches have been based typically on calibrating orthoimage texture or point cloud roughness with particle size. Variable levels of success are reported and a single, robust method capable of producing consistently accurate and precise results in a range of settings has remained elusive. In this paper, we develop an original method for particle size mapping with the specific constraints of sUAS and SfM in mind. This method uses the texture of single sUAS images, rather than orthoimages, calibrated with particle sizes normalised by individual image scale. We compare results against existing orthoimage texture and roughness approaches, and provide the first quantitative investigation into the implications of the use of sUAS camera gimbals. Our results indicate that our novel single image method delivers the optimal particle size mapping performance for our study site, outperforming both other methods and delivering residual mean errors of 0.02mm (accuracy), standard deviation of residual errors of 6.90mm (precision) and maximum residual errors of 16.50mm. Accuracy values are more than two orders of magnitude worse when a camera gimbal is not used, thereby demonstrating the critical importance of mechanical image stabilisation for particle size mapping using measures of image texture.",

This paper explores a variety of definitions from government and third sector organisations in the UK, making comparison with those from other contexts. In particular, it considers whether bullying is repeated behaviour or experience, and how labels such as target, victim and perpetrator have the potential to damage individual identities. It highlights common themes and differences across definitions and interpretations, comparing them with those of staff (n =131) drawn from research in 16 schools in one large local authority area in England, detailing their conceptions and experiences of bullying. These staff identify whether, where and how bullying is encountered in their settings, how they address such issues, and whether there are particular stimuli on which they focus. It concludes that a redeveloped, clear and understandable definition of bullying is needed that is accessible to all stakeholders in schools, including children. This needs to be inclusive in its focus, unambiguous and applicable across a broad range of settings, leaving aside the historical baggage associated with the subject.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of an auditory cue for stepping in place on measures of temporal and weight-bearing asymmetry. Ten community-dwelling adults (four female) with chronic post-stroke hemiparesis performed 5 un-cued stepping trials and 5 stepping trials cued by an auditory metronome cue. A Vicon system was used to collect full body kinematic trajectories. Two force platforms were used to measure ground reaction forces. Step, swing and stance times were used to calculate temporal symmetry ratios. Weight-bearing was assessed using the vertical component of the ground reaction force, and centre of mass-centre of pressure separation at mid-stance. Weight-bearing asymmetry was significantly reduced during stepping with an auditory cue. Asymmetry values for step, swing and stance times were also significantly reduced with auditory cueing. These findings show auditory cueing, when stepping in place, produces immediate reductions in measures of temporal asymmetry and dynamic weight-bearing asymmetry.",

In recent years, next generation sequencing (NGS) emerged as a powerful technology to discover DNA sequence polymorphisms and generate molecular markers very rapidly and cost effectively, accelerating the plant breeding programmes. A single dominant locus, Frl, in tomato provides resistance to the fungal pathogen Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. radicis-lycopersici (FORL), causative agent of Fusarium crown and root rot. In this study, we describe the generation of molecular markers associated with the Frl locus. An F2 mapping population between an FORL resistant and a susceptible cultivar was generated. NGS technology was then used to sequence the genomes of a susceptible and a resistant parent as well the genomes of bulked resistant and susceptible F2 lines. We zoomed into the Frl locus and mapped the locus to a 900 kb interval on chromosome 9. Polymorphic single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the interval were identified and markers co-segregating with the resistant phenotype were generated. Some of these markers were tested successfully with commercial tomato varieties indicating that they can be used for marker-assisted selection in large-scale breeding programmes.",

Aim: In this study, we aim to further explore and synthetize available evidence on the effects of selected plant polyphenols (PP) upon molecular mechanisms associated with oxidative stress and inflammatory pathways. We also aim to briefly discuss PP supplementation as therapeutic tool for the prevention and management of prevalent obesity-associated metabolic disorders. Methods: This narrative review was performed in the PubMed database in June 2018 without restriction of publication period. Results: PP influence a broad range of cell signalling pathways; by modulating the activity of nuclear transcription factors, PP modulate gene expression and antioxidant responses, as well as inflammation and its resolution. Several interventional studies have investigated the effects of PP supplementation in a variety of sample populations, but no consensus has yet been reached regarding composition, dosage or course of treatment for therapeutic purposes. However, overall results tend to suggest a positive effect of PP in either improving metabolic profile or minimizing negative disease outcomes. Careful consideration on PP supplementation is paramount; adverse effects have already been described. Conclusion: The successful prevention and management or treatment of obesity-associated metabolic disorders may be achieved through an effective multidisciplinary approach to tackle their modifiable risk factors. A balanced diet, which includes naturally occurring sources of PP associated with lower consumption of ultra-processed foods, is a relevant approach for the positive health outcomes desired.",

      "rioxx2_description": "The treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) related to a history of sexual and\/or physical abuse in childhood is the subject of international debate, with some favouring a phase-based approach as their preferred treatment, while others argue for immediate trauma-focused treatment. A history of (chronic) traumatisation during childhood has been linked to the development of distinct symptoms that are often labelled as symptoms of complex PTSD. Many therapists associate the presence of symptoms of complex PTSD with a less favourable treatment prognosis. The purpose of this study is to determine whether a phase-based approach is more effective than stand-alone trauma-focused therapy in individuals with PTSD and possible symptoms of complex PTSD resulting from a history of repeated sexual and\/or physical abuse in childhood. An additional aim is to investigate moderators, predictors of treatment (non) response and drop-out. The sample consists of patients between 18 and 65 years old with a diagnosis of PTSD who report a history of repeated sexual and\/or physical abuse in childhood (N = 122). Patients will be blindly allocated to either 16 sessions of eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) therapy preceded by a stabilization phase (eight sessions of Skills Training in Affect and Interpersonal Regulation (STAIR)) or only 16 sessions of EMDR therapy. Assessments are carried out pre-treatment, after every eighth session, post-treatment, and at 3 and 6 months follow up. The main parameter will be the severity of PTSD symptoms (PTSD Symptoms Scale-Self Report). Secondary outcome variables are the presence of a PTSD diagnosis (Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5), severity of complex PTSD symptoms (Structured Interview for Disorders of Extreme Stress-Revised and symptoms-specific questionnaires), changes in symptoms of general psychopathology (Brief Symptom Inventory), and quality of life (Euroqol-5D). Health care consumption and productivity loss in patients will also be indexed. The study results may help to inform the ongoing debate about whether a phase-based approach has added value over immediate trauma-focused therapy in patients suffering from PTSD due to childhood abuse. Furthermore, the results will contribute to knowledge about the safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness of treatments in this target group. Nederlands Trialregister, NTR5991 .
