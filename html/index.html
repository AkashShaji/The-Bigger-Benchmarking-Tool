                The Big Benchmarking Tool
            </h1>
            <p id="main_explanation">
                The Big Benchmarking Tool was created to help universities analyze the amount of sustainability being taught in the curriculum and researched by faculty.
                It was created by students from the Worcester Polytechnic Institute in collaboration with the University of Worcester and Kingston University.<br>

                The tool consists of two parts, the Curriculum Tool and the Research Tool.
                The Curriculum Tool examines the amount of sustainability taught in the available modules and how many students are taking those courses in the formal section of the tool.
                It also evaluates the amount of sustainability that students are interacting with through events and other organizations in the informal section of the tool.<br>

                The Research Tool analyzes the amount of research being done on sustainability-related topics in the formal section of the tool.
                It also looks at what incentives and policies are in place to increase research on sustainability in the informal portion of the tool.<br>

                Any or all of these sections of the tool can be completed at any time.
                The tool allows universities to track their progress on any single question and questions can be skipped if a university feels they are not relevant to their efforts.
                Please click below on either the Curriculum Tool or Research Tool to begin.
