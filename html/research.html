    <h1> Research Tool </h1>
        <p>
            The research tool examines the amount of sustainability related topics or themes that are present in research efforts at a university. This consists of published articles and authors, as well as what efforts are made to increase sustainability knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
            The tool is split into two sections, formal and informal. Formal consists of the research that is being performed. These questions are answered with percentages. Informal consists of questions that are important to increase the amount of sustainability related research being done. They are mainly answered with yes or no responses.
