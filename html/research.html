            <h1> Research Tool </h1>
            <p>
                Welcome to the research benchmarking tool.
                The research tool examines the amount of sustainability related topics or themes that are present in research
                efforts at a university.
                This consists of published articles and authors, as well as what efforts are made to increase sustainability
                knowledge.
            </p>
            <p>
                The tool is split into two sections, formal and informal.
                Formal consists of the research that is being performed. These questions are answered with percentages.
                Informal consists of questions that are important to increase the amount of sustainability related research
                being done.
                They are mainly answered with yes or no responses.
            </p>

                <p id="formal_research">
                    The formal research tool examines research being completed and research that has been published.
                    The questions in the formal research tool are answered with percentages.
                    The formal research tool also makes use of the Research analyzer software which searches an institution’s
                    research database for publications related to sustainability.
                    Results from the formal research tool will give data showing how much focus is put on sustainability related
                    research at the higher education institution.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The tool is run on a json file of consisting of research articles titles, abstracts, and creators for all
                    published research at the university.

                            This question can be answered by contacting the research coordinator of an institution. This may require some dialogue to fully explain the question and what sustainability related means since you will most likely not be allowed to see the grants and funding for research.
                            The Final answer should be a percentage of total sustainability research being funded out of total funded research. Looking for amount of research/amount of research.

                            This question is answered using the same file gathered for the two previous questions. The software outputs a list of the faculty that had published a sustainability-related article in the last year. This list should be cross checked with a list of faculty in each department. If at least one author from the sustainability list is included in the faculty for the department then that department has a staff member. A percentage should be calculated of the those departments found out of the total number of departments.

                            Research Centres and Groups are a collection of researchers that focus their efforts in one particular area or field. They are considered sustainability-related if their research directly relates to one of the Sustainable Development Goals. The keywords we have provided can be used if the topic can not be immediately decided as sustainability-related. The head of your sustainability may be able to answer this question with or without the help of the university’s website.
