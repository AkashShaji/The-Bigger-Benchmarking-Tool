            <h1> Curriculum Tool </h1>
            <p>
                Welcome to the curriculum benchmarking tool. This tool will benchmark sustainability in the curriculum of a higher education institution in an attempt to grade how well sustainability is being taught to its students.
            </p>
            <p>We realize the importance of including sustainability education both in and outside of the classroom. For this reason we benchmark things like, the percentage of modules related to sustainability out of the total modules offered by a university as well as things like, the amount of sustainability related student organizations on campus. While researching sustainability in higher educations we realized that a majority of the focus on bringing sustainability in universities has been on the estates of the universities and teaching sustainability through extracurricular activities. Our benchmarking tool puts more focus on the in class education of sustainability, which we call the formal curriculum. However, trying to compare and score the sustainability in the formal and informal curriculum is like comparing apples to oranges. They are both important to a student learning about sustainability. Therefore we split both the curriculum and research benchmarking tools into two parts, the formal and informal, to be compared and scored separately</p>

                    In order to perform the formal section of the tool, you need to gain access to the module directory for your university.
                    Currently, this is tool can run on a web extension of the module directory.
                    This can either be gathered yourself or by contacting your university’s registrar or data management unit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The tool is run on a csv file of consisting ONLY of the module codes, module titles, and module descriptions for all undergraduate modules.
                    This can either be gathered yourself or by contacting your university’s registrar or data management unit.

                            C4 is meant to take into account how many students have taken more than one module in sustainability. This means that all instances of a module are included in the result of this question. This results in a percentage that is also weighted based on class sizes. There can be a large number of sustainability related modules but maybe only one or two students are taking them.

                            Students can learn about sustainability outside of the classroom. More clubs that are related to sustainability means that more students are able to be involved with sustainability efforts around the university.

                            <b>Question:</b><br>
                            How many SDG-focused educational programs or events engaged the students in the last year?

                            <b>How to answer:</b><br>
                            This question can be answered either by the head of your sustainability department, by someone in the student union, or by looking at a list of student events. Student programs are considered related to sustainability if they have a focus with relates to one of the Sustainable Development Goals. The list of keywords provided can be used if needed to relate student events to sustainability.

                            Sustainability-focused educational programs and events allow for students to learn about sustainability without necessarily committing to a module or student organization.  Having more of these events allows more opportunity for students to get involved in sustainability.

                            Does the university conduct a formal assessment of the sustainability literacy and knowledge of its students?

                            This question can be answered by the head of sustainability at your university.

                            A literacy test is a good way to measure how much your students are actually learning about sustainability. The number of modules that are sustainability-related and which students are taking them matter more if students are learning from them.

                            Does the university have an ongoing program that offers incentives for academic staff to develop new SDG-related modules and/or incorporate the SDGs into existing modules?

                            The head of your research department should be able to answer this question

                            <b>Description of what this question is hoping to gather:</b><br>
                            Increasing the amount of sustainability in modules or creating new sustainability modules is very important. Incentives for staff to make more modules would increase how quickly modules are made and make sure that students are getting the most out of their educations sooner rather than years from now.

                            How many of the Sustainable Development Goals does the institution expose the students to outside of the classroom i.e. buildings, year-round events, or programs?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>How to answer:</b><br>
                            This question should be answerable by the head of your sustainability department and using your university’s website. This question is hoping to gather the areas of sustainability present at a university that a student can learn outside a classroom, either by visiting a location with a focus on one of these areas or through a program that shows what a university is working on with regards to sustainability.
                        </p>

                            <b>Description of what this question is hoping to gather:</b><br>
                            This question is rather open-ended to allow universities to show the extent that they are using their campuses as living laboratories. Estate management is important to a university’s sustainability efforts and many of the efforts that are made would be more valuable if their effects were taught to students. For example, universities may use renewable energy such as solar panels which are a great sustainability effort. However, students may not learn about the solar panels and how the university is trying to improve itself in the sustainability area of energy. If students had the ability to visit the solar panels and learn about the energy they produce, then they would be receiving hand-on instruction in sustainability. A program about sustainable financial investments the universities make would match with the Investment & Finance area.
